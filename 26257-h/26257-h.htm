<p>The Boy Scout Movement has secured a hold on
the American boy that is remarkable in its far-reaching
effects. It is doing a great work in the
development of manliness, self-confidence and physical
perfection and is making better citizens out of
the members of the organization.</p>
<p>This series will foster interest in the Boy Scout
Organization. There is excitement such as every
boy&#8217;s book should contain. There are many and
varied experiences, and much worth-while information
about out-door sports and camp life, in which
the youths take part.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>THE &#8220;INSIDE PASSAGE.&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Ar-r-rouse ye&mdash;r-r-rouse ye, me merry,
merry men,&#8221; boomed the voice of Gerald
Moore, with a slightly Celtic roll of the &#8220;r&#8217;s,&#8221;
as he drummed impatiently on the shutter of the
cabin window, while his companion, Jack Blake,
performed a similar tattoo on the adjoining window.
&#8220;Faith, and it was daylight hours ago, and
ye don&#8217;t know what ye&#8217;re missing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shutter slid back, and the pleasant, if
rather drowsy face of Randolph Peyton peered
forth, and behind his shoulder that of Donald
Graeme.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daylight, did ye say?&#8221; remarked the latter.
&#8220;It&#8217;s my opinion it&#8217;s been daylight all night, for
it surely wasn&#8217;t dark when we retired, and we&#8217;ve
only been in bed a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scene was the outside cabin deck of the
well-appointed steamer &#8220;Queen&#8221; of the Alaska
Steamship Company, which was plowing her way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
through the quiet waters of the &#8220;Inside Passage,&#8221;
on her way to the land of the Yukon and the
Klondike.</p>
<p>The hour was only four in the morning, but
the sun was high, and the day in those high latitudes
was well begun.</p>
<p>&#8220;No regrets, Don, you sleepyhead,&#8221; said Gerald.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve already had seven hours&#8217; sleep,
and on this trip one ought not to go to bed at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time, Jack had succeeded in arousing
his brother, Pepper Blake, and the latter&#8217;s bunk
mate, Dick Wilson, who gazed out a little resentfully,
as they threw back the sash, but whose faces
quickly brightened at the scene that met their
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;there&#8217;s mighty little darkness
up here at this time of year, and I suppose
Don thinks it&#8217;s an awful waste of good daylight
turning it on while we sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll see more than this &#8216;wasted&#8217; when ye
get further north, and I suppose Don will sit
up all night to save it,&#8221; replied Gerald.</p>
<p>This reference to be cautious and prudent, not
to say economical, nature of the canny Scot,
raised a laugh, and the four who had been routed
out of their bunks, through the energy of Jack,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
who, brought up in a newspaper office and atmosphere,
hated to let anything unusual get away
from him, hastily dressed and joined their two
chums on the deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t miss a yard of this scenery,&#8221; said
Jack, &#8220;and we&#8217;ve a few things in that line, along
our native Hudson, to brag about, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The steamer was treading her way through
straits and channels among hundreds of islands
that fenced these almost lake-like waters from
the long swells of the North Pacific. Although
it was the latter part of April, early in the year
for these latitudes, the influence of the warm waters
of the Japanese Gulf Stream could be seen
in the bright green of the islands.</p>
<p>On the other side of the ship, the dark green
forests that clothed the mountains of British Columbia
came down to the very water&#8217;s edge, and
swept by in one majestic panorama.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s certainly lots of scenery to the mile,&#8221;
said Rand, drawing a long breath, as he gazed
in admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;My grandfather said that is what makes Scotland
such a great country,&#8221; remarked Don, catching
at Rand&#8217;s half-humorous comment, &#8220;standing
the land up on end.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s give it the Scout&#8217;s salute,&#8221; suggested
Pepper, with enthusiasm as the laugh over Don&#8217;s
serious remark died away. &#8220;There ought to be
a great echo in those hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; cried Jack, catching Pepper&#8217;s
arm as he unshipped his bugle. &#8220;I had a talk
with the purser last night, and I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll
have to &#8216;cut out&#8217; the bugle calls on this trip. He
says they have an official bugler aboard, for the
call to meals and for the salute at landings, and
we would interfere with him and perhaps affect
the comfort of other passengers who may not be
so keen on the early morning hunt for scenery
as we.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Scout discipline and what might be called
the Scout ritual, to which the boys had been subjecting
themselves for several years, was immediately
apparent in the murmurs of approval
which greeted Jack&#8217;s suggestion. To those who
have followed the career of the Boy Scouts of
Creston on the Hudson, in the preceding volumes
of this series, it is scarcely necessary to introduce
the young men with whom this narrative starts.</p>
<p>The formation of the Patrol of Boy Scouts, at
the suggestion of Colonel Snow, a retired officer
of the United States army; a mysterious robbery,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
and a gallant rescue from the waters of the Hudson,
are told in the first volume, &#8220;Boy Scouts&#8217;
Patrol.&#8221; The second volume leads them into adventures
and difficulties incident to an excursion
on motor cycles that have come to each of them
as a reward for their aid in the rescue referred
to which are told under the title of &#8220;Boy Scouts&#8217;
Motorcycles,&#8221; in the course of which Jack is captured
by moonshiners on whom the boys turn
the tables. &#8220;Boy Scouts&#8217; Canoe Trip,&#8221; brings the
chums into conflict with Sound pirates, during a
canoe trip along the Long Island shore, and give
Pepper and Dick, who are lost in a fog, a chance
to help a foghorn operator of the United States
Lighthouse Service, out of a very serious state
of affairs. &#8220;Boy Scouts in the Rockies,&#8221; the
fourth volume, tells of the perils attending a trip
into the Canadian Northwest, in search of a lost
mine in which they have been given each an interest
by the owner, Mr. Royce; their rescue of
the latter from enemies who are also hunting the
same mine; of hunting among the Indians, and of
the rediscovery of the lost mine which has been
named Uncas, in honor of their patrol.</p>
<p>The fifth volume, under the caption, &#8220;Boy
Scouts&#8217; Aircraft,&#8221; relates how their interest in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
aviation is aroused by the evolutions of a military
aviator viewed during a visit to an army
post; of the building by themselves of a glider
with which they win a contest of these elementary
aircraft, the prize being complete airship motors
of the highest efficiency. With these engines
they equip two aeroplanes and meet with various
adventures of a thrilling nature, including an
aerial kidnapping and pursuit in aeroplanes, the
winning of an aeroplane meet, and the discovery
and deciphering of the Narwhal&#8217;s Tusk, which
starts them on their way to Alaska.</p>
<p>The preceding February, the boys had graduated
from Highcrest Academy, and some weeks
before that event Colonel Snow, who had been for
several years on friendly terms with the boys;
had been the means of inducing them to form the
Scouts&#8217; Patrol, and had looked after their promotion
to be first grade Scouts, had been in
consultation with their parents over a mysterious
matter of which they had as yet learned nothing.</p>
<p>One day in March, as the boys were gathered
in the club room in Mr. Scott&#8217;s house, discussing
plans for a Scout encampment, of the Patrols
of the nearby towns, Colonel Snow entered the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
gate, and they crowded out on the porch to greet
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were just planning to extend our Scout
knowledge and experience by an actual encampment,
this summer&mdash;sort of &#8216;Spring maneuvres&#8217;
you know, like the regulars and National Guard,&#8221;
said Rand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I can offer you something of actual
field experience,&#8221; said Colonel Snow. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what I&#8217;m here for, and if you have time I&#8217;ve a
proposition to make ... rather a cold one,
however.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-i-ce c-c-cream soda?&#8221; inquired Pepper, flippantly,
amid reproving frowns from the other
Scouts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you can&#8217;t even think of that without
shivering in your speech,&#8221; said Jack, with scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind him, Colonel Snow, his appetite
is like the poor, it&#8217;s always with us,&#8221; apologized
Rand.</p>
<p>The army officer smiled indulgently upon the
somewhat abashed Pepper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lose it, Pepper,&#8221; said he. &#8220;That appetite
may prove one of the best of assets in this
proposition of mine. How would you all like
a trip to Alaska?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>The patrol came to &#8220;attention,&#8221; every member
on his feet and for the moment speechless.</p>
<p>&#8220;What! the North Pole?&#8221; gasped Rand, whose
former residence in the Sunny South inclined
him to look upon all high latitudes with suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; replied Colonel Snow, with a
laugh, in which all joined as a kind of relief to
their feelings. &#8220;We shall need neither sleeping
bags nor furs nor pemmican. Let me explain the
situation. Like all retired army officers, I am
subject to call, at times by the government, for
services of various kinds, and I am now intrusted
with a mission in the Controller Bay region of
Alaska, in connection with certain coal deposits
and reservations. In our trip to the Canadian
Rockies, I secured personally, as an investment,
certain timber lands in British Columbia at the
headwaters of the Yukon watershed, and my
purpose is to cut the timber on these lands, to
be eventually floated down the rivers and used
in the various mines and mining camps, now being
developed in both the Yukon and Alaska
territories.</p>
<p>&#8220;On my way to my mission, this Spring, I intend
to take in my sawmill plant and set it up
and get ready for next winter&#8217;s cutting. I shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
be obliged to employ about a dozen men to establish
the plant, and my experience with you
Scouts in the field, in the Northwest, indicates
to me that you can be as useful to me as anyone
I could pick up. It will also give you a
chance to see for the first time a new and growing
country, by which you are bound by all the
ties of government and flag. I will say at once
that I have talked with your parents and your
experience with me in Canada has given them
sufficient confidence to furnish their consent.
The decision rests with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The magnitude of the suggestion stunned the
boys for the time, but they soon regained their
self-possession, and promised an early decision.
So it came about that after discussing the matter
with their parents they had another talk with
the Colonel when final arrangements were made.
The boys, who had already banked three dividends
from the Uncas mine, now a well paying
property, were to outfit themselves, Colonel Snow
paying all other expenses to, in and from Alaska,
and allowing them fair wages while actually engaged
on the sawmill work. Their outfits were
selected by Colonel Snow, who had to veto many
highly colored and fanciful suggestions of snowshoes,
tents, sleeping bags and heavy furs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have an idea,&#8221; said the Colonel, &#8220;that there
will be many days when you boys will be satisfied
with a thin suit of khaki and even yearn for
linen. Even if we should reach the Arctic Circle
in winter, you will remember that our latest Arctic
and Antarctic explorers have about discarded
furs for thick woolens. Above all things, don&#8217;t
forget the mosquito nettings.&#8221;</p>
<p>The night before the Scouts were to leave Creston
they were holding a final meeting at the club-rooms,
when Pepper burst forth excitedly:</p>
<p>&#8220;N-n-now we c-c-an s-solve it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, your appetite?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;N-n-no, the ivory mystery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that; your head?&#8221; put in Rand.</p>
<p>&#8220;N-n-no,&#8221; yelped Pepper, whose face now rivaled
his locks in color and whose fists were doubled
up. &#8220;I mean that ivory&mdash;that narwhal&#8217;s
horn. We&#8217;re going to Alaska and we can find
that cave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, that&#8217;s so. We might get all that
ivory,&#8221; put in Gerald, with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I heard somewhere, but I&#8217;ll not be
sure about it,&#8221; suggested the cautious Don, &#8220;that
there&#8217;s more than five hundred and ninety thousand
square miles in Alaska, and I ha&#8217;e me doots
that we find it the verra first day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>Despite these gibes, their interest was aroused
and the cave, whose mouth was shaped like the
ace of clubs, figured not a little in the imaginations
of the boys, when, followed by the good
wishes of relatives, neighbors and friends, they
entrained the next morning like true soldiers in
their patrol uniforms, and from the rear platform
of the train, sounded the Scout salute to their
native town upon their bugles.</p>
<p>Four days later they joined Colonel Snow, who
had preceded them, in Seattle, and, after two
days of sightseeing in the Washington metropolis,
boarded the &#8220;Queen,&#8221; and at ten o&#8217;clock at
night, steamed out upon Puget&#8217;s Sound, for their
long trip of nearly a thousand miles on the water.</p>
<p>Among the cases of machinery and other
freight, traveling in the vessel&#8217;s hold under Colonel
Snow&#8217;s name, was a long box shaped like
an old-fashioned piano case, which had nothing
to do with Colonel Snow&#8217;s enterprises. Despite
the fact that it weighed more than half a ton, the
boys had clubbed together to pay the rather exorbitant
freight charges upon it. Superfluous
as it appeared at one time to the Colonel, it was
destined to play an important part in the Scouts&#8217;
adventures in the land of gold and glaciers.</p>
<p>An hour of gazing on the scenic wonders that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
sped past on the right and left the morning after
their departure from Seattle, aroused the boys&#8217;
appetites, and they were beginning to long for
the breakfast bugle call, when Colonel Snow
came from his stateroom and bade them a hearty
good morning. He had just redrawn their attention
to the magnificent land and waterscape, with
the remark that Major General Greeley, of Arctic
fame, had made ten voyages to Alaska, and on
each trip found some new wonder in the &#8220;Inside
Passage&#8221; when there arose a chorus of yells,
curses and vituperation from the deck below, and
leaning over the railing, the boys saw a man
with a pistol in his hand backing away from two
who were striking at him with handspikes that
they had grabbed from the side of the vessel.</p>
<p>At the same time a youth of about their own
age dashed in behind the man with the pistol,
and dived between his legs, tripping him up. He
doubled up like a jackknife, fell back against the
gangway gate, which had not been properly fastened,
and shot through it into the tideway, here
very swift, and disappeared. The quickly raised
cry of &#8220;Man Overboard,&#8221; reached the pilot house,
the engine room gong boomed, the screw stopped
and the &#8220;Queen&#8221; gradually lost headway.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>&#8220;SWIFTWATER JIM.&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The Scouts had joined in the cry which notified
the pilot house that a man had gone
overboard, but before the &#8220;Queen&#8221; lost headway
and began to back the man in the water had
slipped some distance astern. Life preservers
and life rings were quickly thrown after him, but
no sooner had the derelict come to the surface
than it was seen that he was dazed and almost
helpless from the effects, probably, of some injury
he had sustained as he went through the
gangway. Luckily, the gangway gate, which
he had pushed out had floated alongside of him
on the tideway, and he had retained consciousness
enough to grasp one side of it with a drowning
man&#8217;s grip, but was in danger of momentarily
losing it. The boys with Colonel Snow at
their head had rushed along the upper rail, where
Rand began at once to strip off his coat and the
soft canoe shoes he was wearing on shipboard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
while Gerald followed suit. All the boys, as became
trained Scouts, were good swimmers, but
Rand pushed Gerald back, impetuously, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the heavier, Gerald, let me go on this. It
may be a fight,&#8221; and at the same time mounted
the rail. As he did so, Colonel Snow seized a
long thin line that hung for just such emergencies,
on a spike at the rail, threw the knotted
loop over Rand&#8217;s arm and shoulder, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;These are cold waters, and you may need
this. If it hampers you, cast it off, and take to
the gangplank.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rand leaped from the rail, with his utmost
strength, striving to escape the suction of the
now backward-revolving screw, and struck out
toward the man whose head was sinking under
the surface, although his hands still grasped the
gangplank with a feeble hold. With a dozen
stalwart strokes, Rand reached the almost unconscious
man, threw the loop from his own shoulder
over his head and drew it under his arms
and placed both his hands firmly upon the plank.
Then grasping the bolt staple of the timber, himself,
he yelled:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull in; don&#8217;t back any further,&#8221; and in a few
minutes willing and stalwart hands dragged
them toward the steamer.</p>

RAND LEAPED FROM THE RAIL.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>Already, a lifeboat had been dropped into the
water and into this the half-drowned man was
lifted, while Rand, himself already numbed by
the icy water had to be assisted aboard. He was
lifted to the deck amid the cheers of his chums,
who rushed him to his stateroom for dry clothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a great piece of work,&#8221; said Captain
Huxley, commander of the &#8220;Queen.&#8221; &#8220;No professional
life saver could have got on the job in
quicker time. Those are fine boys of yours, Colonel
Snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s part of their training as Scouts,&#8221; replied
the Colonel, &#8220;and it&#8217;s meant to be practical.
That&#8217;s why I did not interfere with Peyton&#8217;s attempt
at a rescue. But what started this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to find out, good and
quick,&#8221; replied Captain Huxley. &#8220;As usual at
this time of year, I&#8217;ve got a tough crowd in the
steerage, and I imagine the whole thing started
in a poker game that has been running on the
engine room deck ever since we left Seattle. Will
you go along?&#8221;</p>
<p>Accompanied by Colonel Snow and the boys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
who joined them at that moment, Rand none the
worse for his first dip in Pacific waters, Captain
Huxley strode down to the engine room, where
first aid had been administered to the half-drowned
man, who had come to his senses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well; if it isn&#8217;t &#8216;Swiftwater Jim,&#8217;&#8221; exclaimed
the Captain. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t know we had you
aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wa&#8217;al, ye come mighty near losin&#8217; me,&#8221; the
patient answered, and then continued. &#8220;I come
on board just as ye were castin&#8217; off last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;ye come to get into the water? That
hasn&#8217;t been a very popular element with you in
the past; eh, Jim,&#8221; said the Captain with a grin.
&#8220;Colonel Snow, let me introduce Swiftwater Jim,
an ancient Alaskan that I believe we took over
with the territory under the Seward treaty with
Russia in 1867, and the oldest &#8216;Sourdough&#8217; in
any one of the six districts. He&#8217;s made at least a
dozen trips with me. He usually owns the boat
going &#8216;out,&#8217; but is satisfied with the steerage going
&#8216;in&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Snow grasped the miner&#8217;s hand, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Swiftwater Jim is no stranger to anyone who
knows the history of the Alaskan country. Let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
me introduce some young fellows who are making
their first trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>The miner, whose drying garb was made up of
a mixture of the costume of the frontier pioneer
and garments of the latest cut, shook hands with
the boys as he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay ye captain, for puttin&#8217; me back in the
mammoth class, but what I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; for is the
feller that went into the dew after me. That
certainly was a few damp moments. I was rattled,
but I knew somebody grabbed me just before
the light went out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the chap,&#8221; said Captain Huxley, as
he shoved the reluctant Rand to the front.</p>
<p>The miner grasped Rand&#8217;s hand and gazed into
his face with a solemn stare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wa&#8217;al, wa&#8217;al, such a young feller, too.
How&#8217;d ye do it?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s part of our training as Scouts,&#8221; replied
Rand, modestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scouts, eh?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Embreeo soldiers,
eh? I heard of them this last trip out to the
States. Wa&#8217;al, Mr. Peyton, I ain&#8217;t a goin&#8217; to
make no fervent speech of gratitood, for ye know
how I feel, and I ain&#8217;t trimmed up to make a
more substantial showin&#8217; just now, but if you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
boys is a goin&#8217; &#8216;in&#8217; as we say, ye&#8217;ll hear from
Swiftwater Jim before ye come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us how it happened, Jim,&#8221; said Captain
Huxley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, now, Captain, ye know me and ye
know I can take care of me own troubles,&#8221; replied
Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Jim,&#8221; said Captain Huxley, sternly.
&#8220;You know I&#8217;m boss here, so long as you&#8217;re
afloat, and anything of this kind demands investigation.
Besides, I don&#8217;t propose to have a
traveling feud on my manifest, all the way to
Skagway. Out with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wa&#8217;al, Captain,&#8221; said Swiftwater, &#8220;when I
come aboard last night I found among the ruck
in the steerage that gambler, Dublin, and a limpy
pal of his. We got to playing poker, and the two
of them cleaned me out, and because I found them
using marked cards they came after me with
them spikes. A young feller that was with
them jumped on my back, and I went overboard.
I&#8217;ll tend to &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t, Jim,&#8221; remarked Captain Huxley.
&#8220;From this to Skagway you&#8217;ll bunk on my
deck and keep away from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning to a couple of the crew, the commander
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
of the &#8220;Queen&#8221; said: &#8220;Bring that Dublin
crowd here.&#8221; The men hurried away, and
in a few minutes presented to the astonished eyes
of the Scouts their old acquaintances and quasi-enemies,
Dublin, Limpy Rae, and Monkey Rae.
The latter favored the boys with a look of hatred
and a muttered imprecation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t done nothin&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;began Dublin.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do, Dublin,&#8221; replied Captain Huxley.
&#8220;You know me of old, and I want to say
I should have refused you passage if I had known
you were going back to the Klondike. If you
start another card game on this boat or get into
any other trouble, I&#8217;ll put you in irons, and hand
you over to the authorities when we reach port.
I&#8217;m not sure that there are not several United
States marshals in Alaska, yearning for a sight
of you, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dublin turned white, attempted to speak, and
then with his companions slunk back into the
steerage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we saw Monkey Rae trip up this man,&#8221;
said Jack pointing to Swiftwater, &#8220;but we didn&#8217;t
know it was Monkey then. It was a cowardly
attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Captain Huxley, &#8220;we&#8217;ll let the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
matter drop now, unless Swiftwater complains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not me,&#8221; said the miner, turning away. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
see to this myself, later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not here, though,&#8221; said Captain Huxley,
sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can trust me, Captain,&#8221; replied Swiftwater,
as he waved his hand to the boys and Colonel
Snow, and walked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said the Captain of the &#8220;Queen,&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ve missed the first bugle blast for
breakfast, but I should be glad to have you, Colonel
Snow and your young men join my table
at meals for the voyage.&#8221;</p>
<p>This signal honor was highly appreciated by
the boys, for at meals they were introduced to
several territorial officials, capitalists and army
officers, who, with the women of their families,
were going in with the advent of Spring in
Alaska. The tale of Rand&#8217;s feat had preceded
them, and the poor fellow spent a rather uncomfortable
and embarrassing half hour of compliments
and congratulations from men whose experience
had taught them to appreciate a gallant
deed.</p>
<p>Colonel Snow finally came to Rand&#8217;s rescue
by turning the talk to the rescued man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A great character, Swiftwater Jim, Captain
Huxley?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the commander of the &#8220;Queen,&#8221;
&#8220;and Alaska history is full of his vagaries. He&#8217;s
probably the best equipped prospector and all-round
miner in the territory, but it does him no
good. He has owned twenty mines, and has
made a dozen fortunes and spent them all. Every
time he makes a &#8216;stake&#8217; as he calls it, he indulges
in extravagances that make one doubt his sanity.
He went out last fall with fifty thousand
dollars in dust, and I dare say will be working
for day wages when he gets back in.</p>
<p>&#8220;He visited New York on this trip, and caused
something of a sensation even there while his
money held out. His diversions are innocent,
turning largely to investments in food and drink,
a tendency born, I suppose, of long privations in
the Arctic. His most humorous exploit on this
trip was entering the most fashionable restaurant
in the metropolis, and ordering fifty dollars worth
of ham and eggs, after vainly attempting to make
out the French of the bill of fare.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Snow and the boys laughed, and the
former said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I presume little of his money is really spent
on himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the Captain. &#8220;He is the soul of
generosity and scatters it right and left. Of
course, a good deal of it goes to the leeches who
cluster around such characters in the cities. Still,
although he has the average pioneer&#8217;s contempt
for Indians and Eskimos he has given liberally
to the missions which are civilizing them. He
may make another fortune, but I believe he will
die poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;D-d-did he eat all that order of ham and
eggs?&#8221; asked Pepper with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hardly think so,&#8221; smiled the Captain.
&#8220;I doubt if the order was really served. Head
waiters of these big restaurants have very diplomatic
ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Huxley, what is a &#8216;Sourdough&#8217;? I
heard you apply the word to Swiftwater Jim,&#8221;
said Jack, on the alert for information.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aristocracy of the Alaskan mining camp,&#8221;
replied the officer. &#8220;The man who has been at
least a year in the territory, and is &#8216;wise&#8217; as you
boys say, to its methods and manners, and inured
to its hardships and its climate. For a time you&#8217;ll
belong to the &#8216;Chee-chak-O&#8217; class.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked Rand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indian name for what the men on the
Canadian ranches called &#8216;tenderfeet,&#8217;&#8221; replied
Colonel Snow.</p>
<p>At this moment the vessel experienced a slight
shock, and the dining saloon seemed to rise on a
long and gentle undulation, and as gently to sink
to an appreciable depth. The motion continued
regularly for a few minutes, and Captain Huxley
glanced keenly at the guests at his table, with a
barely perceptible smile on his face.</p>
<p>A puzzled and rather serious expression came
over the faces of several of those at breakfast.
Suddenly, Dick exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re losing a good deal of this scenery,&#8221; and
passed out on the deck, to be followed almost immediately
by Pepper and Don. The Boy Scouts
had met with a new sensation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>INTO ROUGH WATERS.</h3>
</div>

<p>The Boy Scouts of Creston, although expert
in nearly all water sports, and familiar
with the gently flowing Hudson, and the quiet
inland tides of bay and Sound, had had no experience
as yet of ocean travel. The Alaska trip
was the first test of their sailor-like qualities. In
the &#8220;Inside passage&#8221; are two stretches of twenty
and forty miles, where the full sweep of the Pacific
rollers is felt, and it was while crossing one
of these stretches that the &#8220;Queen&#8221; took on those
erratic motions that sent Dick Pepper and Don
to the open air so quickly and caused not a few
of their fellow travelers considerable discomfort.</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, none of the other boys
were affected by the rough waters, and they
quickly followed their chums to the deck to offer
aid and comfort. It has always been one of the
peculiarities of seasickness that, however important
and serious it may seem to the victim, it is
prone to arouse ridicule and humorous suggestions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
in those who are not subject to its attacks,
and while Rand, Jack and Gerald did what they
could for their unfortunate companions, they
could not resist the temptation of an occasional
sly reference to their chums&#8217; poor qualities as sailors,
that under any other circumstances would
have driven the combative Pepper frantic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wa&#8217; yo tellin&#8217; me, hoeny, tha&#8217; wa&#8217; some great
scenery, ovah da&#8217;?&#8221; suggested Rand, falling into
a broad Southern dialect that he used at times.</p>
<p>Poor Dick, whose interest centered in the dark
blue of the water beneath him, attempted a glare
of indignation with poor results, while Don made
no attempt to express the briefest kind of an
&#8220;opeenion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, and this the celebrated <i>mal de mer</i>, is
it?&#8221; said Gerald, gazing with mock curious interest
at his wilted chums.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s brutal, Gerald,&#8221; exclaimed Jack, &#8220;seasickness
is bad enough, without any of your Celtic
High School French.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Begorra, it&#8217;s about all of it I remember, and
maybe I&#8217;ll never get a chance to use it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish it was catching, like the measles or
mumps,&#8221; gulped Pepper in a fury, &#8220;and I&#8217;d give
it to you all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What, French?&#8221; asked his brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw, seasickness,&#8221; yelled Pepper, and bolted
for his stateroom to be soon followed by his two
companions in misfortune. A couple of hours
in their bunks with some little attention from
their now rather repentant critics, and the
steamer having passed again into still water the
patients were soon restored to normal health,
with, if possible, greatly increased appetities.</p>
<p>Two days later, Jack, who was ever on the
alert for something new and had made friends
with several of the officers, thus getting the run
of the ship, was exploring the lower decks, and
walked through the quarters of the third class
passengers. These were largely made up of laboring
men going &#8220;in&#8221; for the summer work. A
few miners who had spent all their money in the
Pacific coast cities, and were going back to try
their luck again, and a few of the class whom
the police of those and other cities had simply
told to &#8220;move on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The steerage quarters were rather dark, and
hearing voices Jack stepped aside into a narrow
passageway between the bunks to let a couple
of men pass. The two turned into the same
passageway which concealed Jack, and the latter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
recognizing the voice of Dublin sank down into
one of the further berths as the others sat down
on a couple of bunks near the entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell ye it&#8217;s a better game than the other,&#8221;
said Dublin, &#8220;and we&#8217;re goin&#8217; in for anything
we can make.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not strong for any new game that I don&#8217;t
understand,&#8221; whined the voice of Rae, &#8220;and we&#8217;re
in bad on this boat, as it stands. We&#8217;ll find games
enough of our own when we git to Skagway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lose yer nerve,&#8221; said Dublin, &#8220;with a
good chance to make a stake in sight. These
folks is takin&#8217; in a lot of fine machinery, and that
Yukon country is a long ways from where that
machinery is made, and every nut and bolt in it
will be worth its weight in coin by the time
they&#8217;ve got it in there. All we got to do is to
cop off a piston and a valve or two and this army
man will be willin&#8217; to pay several hundred dollars
to get &#8217;em back rather than wait for months
to get &#8217;em in from the outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Rae, &#8220;ye know that stealin&#8217;
up in this country is bigger crime than murder,
and they don&#8217;t fool with the courts much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, this ain&#8217;t stealin&#8217;,&#8221; sneered Dublin, &#8220;it&#8217;s
only kidnappin&#8217; and holdin&#8217; for ransom. I know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
just whereabouts in the hold this stuff was stored
at Seattle, and that kid, Monkey, of yours, can
get at it in ten minutes if he has the nerve. The
stuff is not a hundred feet from us, and I can
show him tonight how to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rae, who was more or less of a coward, made
further protest, but finally yielded, and the pair
slipped out of the passageway and walked away
still discussing the proposed scheme. Jack, glad
to be released from the rather odorous confinement
of the bunk into which he had crowded
himself, left the third-class quarters and made
for the upper deck.</p>
<p>His newspaper training, of which he had received
a considerable amount in the intervals of
his school days in the office of his father&#8217;s paper
in Creston, included an acute sense of analysis,
and he at once arrived at the opinion that the
conspiracy he had heard referred to the freight
which Colonel Snow was taking North, and his
first impulse was to lay the matter before him
for such action as he might see fit to take.</p>
<p>Then a foolish ambition to handle the thing
alone, born possibly of that newspaper desire to
bring off a &#8220;scoop&#8221; as an exclusive publication
is called, coupled with the usual boyish longing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
to become a hero, incited him to circumvent the
plot singlehanded and alone, prevented him from
speaking to either the leader of the party or his
chums. In addition, his journalistic training had
instilled deeply one of the first rules of the profession,
accuracy, and to tell the truth he was
rather ashamed to go to Colonel Snow with so
little evidence to back up his story, and so he determined
to &#8220;keep tabs,&#8221; as he called it, on Monkey
Rae, and knowing he could handle that young
man physically to capture him redhanded and
take him in dramatic fashion before the Captain.</p>
<p>Jack had no doubt that Dublin would carry
out any scheme he had in mind at the first opportunity,
and that the attempt to get into the hold
would be made at a hatchway on the same deck
with the steerage. The hold at this part of the
ship being filled with machinery and other heavy
freight, the hatch cover was not battened down
and most of the time was left partially off in order
to give a circulation of air through that part of
the hold under the steerage.</p>
<p>About ten o&#8217;clock that night, Jack slipped away
from his companions, and descended to the engine
room deck, where he took up his place behind
some packing cases, and awaited developments.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
Nearly all the steerage passengers were
in their quarters, for the night was keen and there
was little enjoyment in the open air.</p>
<p>An hour passed and Jack was becoming weary
of his vigil, especially in view of the uncertainty
of the coming of his quarry. Then, from the
passageway leading to the steerage a slim figure
emerged and by the dim light of the lamp which
illuminated this part of the deck, Jack was just
able to recognize Monkey, who carried in one
hand a hatchet, and something like a policeman&#8217;s
club in the other. Monkey glanced rapidly
around the deck, looking for the watchman who
at times visited every portion of the ship, but the
coast was clear.</p>
<p>Crossing the deck the boy slipped easily between
the partly raised hatch cover and the combing,
and down the stationary iron ladder into the
dark hold. As he did so a ray of light appeared
in the hitherto dark hold. Glancing around to
be sure that neither Dublin nor Rae were standing
sentinel for the young marauder, Jack slipped
noiselessly over the deck, and followed Monkey
down the ladder.</p>
<p>A glance showed him that what Monkey carried
in his right hand was a portable electric light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
and with this he was carefully searching for the
marks upon some packing cases.</p>
<p>Jack tiptoed quietly toward him, intending to
take him unawares, failing in his eagerness to
make the capture to allow Monkey to make an attack
upon the case with his hatchet sufficiently to
&#8220;clinch&#8221; his evidence.</p>
<p>Just as Jack put out his hand to grasp the arm
that held the hatchet his foot struck an unseen
coil of rope, and he plunged head foremost into
Monkey. The latter pitched forward three or
four steps and Jack landed on his hands and
knees, an accident that probably saved him serious
injury, for at the moment the terror-stricken
Monkey turned and aimed a furious blow at
whatever had struck him.</p>
<p>At the same time he dropped the electric light,
which promptly went out as the spring was released,
and the hold was in darkness. Jack dared
not move for fear of the hatchet, and all he could
hear was the loud breathing of the terrified Monkey,
who carefully began to grope for the lost
lamp. The search was vain, and Jack was slowly
backing away from the vicinity toward the ladder,
intending to bar Monkey&#8217;s egress when he
heard a movement that seemed to indicate that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
Monkey was climbing up the piled-up freight.
Then there were two loud blows with the hatchet
on the deck above them which formed the floor
of the steerage quarters.</p>
<p>Scarcely a minute passed before a man with
another electric light swarmed down the ladder,
and Jack was in the hands of the powerful Dublin.
At the same moment, Monkey dropped his
hatchet and dashed past them to the ladder, where
he hung like his simian namesake, calling shrilly
for the night watchman. Jack made an effort to
twist himself loose from the hands of Dublin,
but in vain.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are ye doin&#8217; down here, ye thief? Tryin&#8217;
to get at the cargo? Call the quartermaster
there, Monkey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Realizing the trap into which he had fallen,
Jack made no further effort to release himself until
he reached the deck above, when he jerked away
from Dublin and faced the quartermaster and the
watchman. There they were joined by Rae and
some of the other steerage passengers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well; if it ain&#8217;t one o&#8217; them boy Scouts;
them amateur soldiers. Where d&#8217;ye find him,
Monkey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I seen him hanging round this deck and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
he slipped down in the hold with a hatchet and
a &#8217;lectric light. I followed him. He jumped
onto me and I run back to the ladder and yelled
for Dublin, and he come and got him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about this, young feller?&#8221; asked the
quartermaster. &#8220;What were you doin&#8217; down that
hold this time o&#8217; night. Ain&#8217;t ye one of Colonel
Snow&#8217;s party?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;and this man&#8217;s story is a
straightout falsehood. It was I who followed
this boy down into the hold on information that
I got&#8221;&mdash;</p>
<p>A burst of laughter from both Rae and Dublin
interrupted Jack&#8217;s story, and both men swore
vehemently that Monkey had been in his berth
up to a few minutes before he had called for
Dublin. Jack, recognizing his folly in not having
notified Colonel Snow and the Captain of the
conspiracy, and also the way in which the tables
had been turned upon him in his attempt to &#8220;go
it alone,&#8221; said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I will explain this thing to the Captain; I
think he will understand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;d better,&#8221; said the puzzled quartermaster;
&#8220;but we can&#8217;t wake him up tonight.
I&#8217;ll see ye up to yer stateroom and you can explain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
in the morning. And you,&#8221; he said,
sharply, turning to Dublin and Monkey, &#8220;you
be on hand with your story. Meantime,&#8221; to the
watchman, &#8220;put on that hatch cover and lock it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As early the next morning as possible, Jack
sought an interview with Col. Snow and told him
the whole story. The latter was greatly interested,
but said plainly that Jack should not have
undertaken to handle the matter by himself.</p>
<p>The Captain was not so easily pacified. He
heard both stories and grinned quietly as both
Rae and Dublin tried to make a hero out of
Monkey.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you fellows you&#8217;re too much in evidence
on this boat and I don&#8217;t want to hear anything
more from you until we get to Skagway.&#8221;
Col. Snow&#8217;s intercession arranged matters for
Jack but he did not get off any too easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any doubt but that your story has
a good foundation, but it would hardly go as evidence
in a court of law, and even if the Colonel
here thought it worth while, I don&#8217;t suppose he
cares to be bothered with a prosecution in courts
that are three years behind with their cases. I shall
take occasion to draw the attention of the authorities
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
to this crowd, when we reach Skagway,
however.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to say, however, that in a case
like this, your first duty was to have informed
me, and let me police my own boat. I am the superior
officer here, as you know. I understand
you belong to that excellent organization, the Boy
Scouts, and if I am not mistaken, there is one
little line in the ritual devoted to discipline. Good
morning.&#8221; And despite the rebuke which brought
the flush to Jack&#8217;s face, the captain smiled, and
shook hands pleasantly.</p>
<p>The story could not be kept from the chums,
who were rather inclined to resent Jack&#8217;s failure
to let them take a hand in the capture of Monkey
Rae. They rallied Jack not a little on his grand
effort at heroism and Rand even dug up an old
schoolbook quotation about an engineer who had
been hoist with his own petard. The boys took
their disappointment out in various good natured
gibes, and mock congratulations to &#8220;the Sherlock
Holmes of the good steamer Queen&#8221; were a
daily occurrence until the arrival at Ketchikan
and new scenes drove the incident from the boys&#8217;
memories. It was to be recalled in much more
serious form a little later.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>ON ALASKAN SOIL.</h3>
</div>

<p>The acquaintance between the Boy Scouts and
Swiftwater Jim, which had begun with
Rand&#8217;s rescue of the old Klondiker, ripened before
many days of the voyage had elapsed into
something like warm friendship and the miner
became a wellspring of joy to the young men in
the wealth of adventure narrative that fell from
his lips and the quiet humor of his views of life.
His removal by Captain Huxley, to the saloon
deck on which they were berthed, gave them
constant opportunity for meeting him, and as
the novelty of the scenery and surroundings gradually
wore off, they turned more and more to his
companionship and plied him incessantly with
cross-examination as to the peculiarities of the
new land which they were about to enter.</p>
<p>At one time in command of a whaler in Bering
Sea waters, his ship had been one of six
crushed in the ice of the Arctic sea, the crews of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
which had been forced to winter at Point Barrow,
the most northerly point of the United States,
where the government had established a whaling
relief station.</p>
<p>The enormous burden thrown upon this relief
station by the influx of so great a number of dependents
coming from the whalers, who had no
means of getting away, threatened starvation for
all and only by the greatest good fortune did
word reach the government at Washington,
which at once took steps for their relief. Lieut.
Jarvis of the Revenue Marine Service, who was
in the east at the time on furlough, from his ship,
a revenue cutter engaged in patroling Bering Sea
to protect the seal fisheries, volunteered to make
the effort to relieve the starving men, although
he was leaving the bedside of a sick wife whom
he might never see again. Bering Sea and the
Arctic are frozen over six months at a time, and
the relief expedition must be made over the frozen
tundra and uninhabited snow waste, eighteen hundred
miles in extent, from the Seward Peninsula
to the &#8220;top of the continent,&#8221; as Swiftwater Jim
termed it.</p>
<p>The problem as to how to transport the food
for these men over this great expanse of country,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
barren of trails and almost impassible in places,
was solved by Lieutenant Jarvis and his aides.
By assembling from the various reindeer stations
which the government had established in the Far
North, a large herd of reindeer which they drove
the entire distance to Point Barrow, they arrived
just in time to relieve the hundreds of men who
were on the verge of starvation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell ye,&#8221; said Swiftwater Jim, in telling the
story to the boys, &#8220;I have never seen anything
on earth since that looked so good as them deer.
There we was, a dirty, unsightly mob so near
to death that we had lost about all resemblance to
humanity, and not a single human feelin&#8217; left for
each other. It was every man for himself and
mighty little that he could do, then.</p>
<p>&#8220;That feller Jarvis was the man for the job.
That relief expedition was received very much
as I hear explorers are met by the savagest tribes
of Africa, and if it hadn&#8217;t been for the nerve of
those three officers at the head of it, they would
have lost their lives and the provision they had
brought would not have lasted three weeks. But
those fellows took command at once; headed off
a mutiny, distributed the provisions daily and for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
months ran that gang, made up of the off-scourings
of the seas, by reg&#8217;lar army discipline.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the months before the ice broke up, and
vessels could come after us, he governed with a
mighty stiff hand, and every man who was fed
by government relief, and thay wan&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
else, was compelled to live up to regulations of
cleanliness and daily exercise, which is the only
thing that will save a man&#8217;s health in that deadly
Arctic climate where the bill o&#8217; fare is only about
one line long, and a healthy body is the only thing
that will save a man&#8217;s mind from that deadly depression
that ends in insanity. When the ships
come finally, that mob of whaler men was cleaner
and healthier than they ever were in their lives
before and they had a mighty lot of love and
respect for Jarvis and the officers with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was about the biggest sacrifice a man ever
made, that voluntary trip of Jarvis, and I believe
that Congress, after thinkin&#8217; a long time about it
finally acknowledged it by votin&#8217; him some kind
of a medal. As for me I hain&#8217;t been able to look
a poor little reindeer in the face since.&#8221;</p>
<p>With his vessel a splintered derelict in the ice
of the Arctic sea, Swiftwater had taken to mining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
and had covered a good part of Alaska in his
wanderings.</p>
<p>Col. Snow had noticed with considerable interest
the growing intimacy between his young
charges and the miner and had taken occasion
himself to have several talks with the ancient
&#8220;sourdough&#8221; as Swiftwater insisted on calling
himself. The Colonel had found among the army
officers returning to their posts in the North several
old friends of his army days and had taken
the opportunity to make some inquiries as to
the miner with evidently satisfactory results.
These army officers Col. Snow took occasion to
introduce to the Boy Scouts and the element of
courtesy that is a strong feature of the West
Pointers&#8217; character showed itself in the consideration
given the boys by these grizzled men, several
of whom had won their spurs during Indian
outbreaks in the West and later learned the stern
demands of war in Cuba and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Their journey was enlivened by many a good
story of camp and field and incidentally the officers
evinced a strong curiosity in the organization
of the Boy Scouts about which they asked
many questions.</p>
<p>The day the &#8220;Queen&#8221; arrived at Ketchikan, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
first port in Alaska, Col. Snow, after starting the
boys on a sightseeing trip through the town, put
in some time in company with Swiftwater Jim
in the office of the United States Commissioner,
who is practically a local judge. When all had
returned to the steamer that night, Col. Snow
called the boys together in the big saloon of the
vessel for a talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; said the army officer, &#8220;that after
I have seen you and the machinery disembarked
in Skagway, I must leave you to carry out my
mission to Controllers Bay and Valdez, and that
I shall not be able to join you in the Yukon Country
until later in the summer. It has been my
purpose, of course, to place you in charge of a
competent manager who will really command the
expedition the rest of the way until the machinery
is installed on the timber land that I intend to
exploit. Of course you will be furnished with
sufficient expert Indian labor to assist in navigating
the streams over which this freight must
be transported, for there are no roads, and water
at this season of the year is the only transportation
available. What do you think of Swiftwater
Jim for commander-in-chief, guide, philosopher
and friend to this expedition?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;B-b-bully,&#8221; exclaimed Pepper, adopting the
vernacular of an ex-President.</p>
<p>&#8220;The very man for the place if I understand
what we are to do,&#8221; commented Rand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, now we will see Alaska; and what we
don&#8217;t see, Swiftwater is the man to tell us about,&#8221;
cried the enthusiastic Gerald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if we can get him,&#8221; said the cautious
Don, &#8220;there&#8217;s nobody we&#8217;d like so well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might as well tell you that it&#8217;s all arranged,&#8221;
said the Colonel. &#8220;He was the best man I could
find for the work I want done, and I took the first
opportunity to arrange with him; but at the same
time I am glad that you are all so well satisfied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have you understand that Swiftwater
will be the leader of the party and in all things
you will be under his direction. I do not think
it will be necessary for me to tell you that the
discipline will be perhaps a little more strict than
it has been in the ranks of the patrol at home, and
while it will not be on an unrestricted army basis,
there will be some resemblance and I shall trust
to your experience as Scouts to induce in you
cheerful acquiescence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be something like a campaign then,&#8221;
suggested Dick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a good deal like a campaign,&#8221; smilingly
replied the Colonel, &#8220;and while there will
be much that is enjoyable and novel, there won&#8217;t
be much peaches and cream about it. Plunging
into a wilderness as you must, you leave behind
all the comforts and most of the sanitary safeguards
of civilization, and it is absolutely necessary
for the preservation of your health that you
adopt certain rules of diet and comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we have to diet?&#8221; inquired Pepper, doubtfully,
whose mind reverted to certain milk and
porridge days, imposed after an orgy of green
fruit and its consequent painful disturbances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t use the word in the sense that you
mean, Pepper,&#8221; said Col. Snow. &#8220;There will be
plenty to eat and I hope well prepared, but you
must govern yourself as to how you deal with it.
Food in most parts of Alaska is a costly proposition,
but I guess we shall have enough to go
round unless the wild life increases your already
healthy appetites.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hae ma doots,&#8221; said Don, falling into his
Gaelic-accented English, as he often did when
he seemed to be wrestling with a problem, &#8220;if yon
appetite of Pepper&#8217;s can increase much wi&#8217;out
straining the capacity.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look after your own appetite,&#8221; said Pepper,
growing red, &#8220;I read once in a book that four
thousand years of oatmeal porridge, three times
a day, had wiped out every appetite and spoiled
every stomach in Scotland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there,&#8221; admonished Jack, &#8220;that&#8217;ll be
about all of that. You fellows are about even
now. The smallest sort of an appetite may prove
to be an inconvenience before we get out of
Alaska.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to say, Colonel,&#8221; said Rand, rising and
facing the army officer at &#8220;attention,&#8221; &#8220;that I
think I speak for the whole patrol when I promise
in their names the most earnest fidelity and strict
attention to rules and regulations until our mission
up here is finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; echoed the Scouts, springing to
their feet and saluting the Colonel, who also rose
and returned it with a smile of acknowledgment.
At the same moment Swiftwater Jim entered the
saloon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young men, your commander,&#8221; said Colonel
Snow, waving a hand toward the miner. With
one accord the patrol turned toward the grizzled
Alaskan and saluted. Jim turned red with pleasure
and waved a knotted hand in recognition.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to see ye, boys, but salutin&#8217; won&#8217;t be
necessary ev&#8217;ry time we meet. I used ter be satisfied
on shipboard if a man jumped about a foot
high every time I spoke real serious, but I guess
we can get through this job without much loud
bossin&#8217;. I simply want ter sejest that I ain&#8217;t very
good at argying, so I hope we shan&#8217;t have much
of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>One by one, the boys shook hands with the
miner in token of fealty, and from that time
until the steamer reached Skagway spent several
hours a day with him in what he called his &#8220;first
class in gettin&#8217; on the job.&#8221; The most of this
work included thorough instruction in the geography
of Southeastern Alaska and Southern
Yukon territory, the Colonel&#8217;s land being located
in the Canadian dominions. Especially was their
attention drawn to numerous waterways as
shown on the maps, which must form the highways
for all transportation during the summer
time, and knowledge of whose location, size and
tributaries formed a man&#8217;s best safeguard in this
almost pathless wilderness.</p>
<p>A visit was paid to the hold, this time with the
captain&#8217;s permission, to enable Swiftwater to estimate
the amount of freight that was to be handled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
and the best way of distributing it among
the transports. The boys went with him to learn
something of their new duties in this connection.</p>
<p>&#8220;I move,&#8221; said Rand, &#8220;that that earnest young
sleuth, Mr. Jack Blake, be appointed guide to this
expedition to the dark and creepy hold. He
knows where everything is, for he has fallen over
it all, I hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He might meet Monkey Rae,&#8221; said Dick with
a mock shudder, &#8220;then think of the carnage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dublin and the Raes, fearing Captain Huxley&#8217;s
possible report to the authorities at Skagway, had
&#8220;jumped the ship&#8221; as the commander of the
&#8220;Queen&#8221; expressed it at Ketchikan, the first port
of call in Alaska, and Dick&#8217;s fears were therefore
groundless, but Jack, who had learned the
lesson of taking a joke goodnaturedly grinned
feebly, and readily dived into the hatchway and
down the ladder. The electric lights had been
turned on, and the hitherto Egyptian darkness
of the hold had vanished. They readily found
their consignment, and the miner went over it
carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;What ye got here?&#8221; he asked, kicking the
heavy case before referred to, which the boys had
brought along on their own initiative. &#8220;Pianny?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
Don&#8217;t believe we need any pianny, up Yukon
way. There&#8217;s plenty piannys in Alaska, now, but
I remember the first one that was brought in.
It&#8217;s up in Dawson yet. It was brought in on
the first rush in &#8217;98. Cost four hundred dollars
in the States and two thousand dollars to haul
up from Skagway. The last time I heard it, it
was being mauled by a feenominon, who had a
patent pianny-playin&#8217; wooden arm on one side, and
it sounded like a day&#8217;s work in a boiler factory
at one end and a bad smash in a glass pantry at
the other. I heard some o&#8217; them educated Cheechakos
talkin&#8217; about art, but I didn&#8217;t care for it
much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a piano,&#8221; said Gerald as the laugh subsided.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a little enterprise of our own, and
is to be put in storage in Skagway until we&#8217;re
through with our work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wa&#8217;al,&#8221; replied the guide, as he tested its
weight, &#8220;we don&#8217;t have to handle it then, and
that&#8217;s something of a load off my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day when the boy Scouts awoke they
found the vessel anchored in the picturesque harbor
of Skagway, the end of the &#8220;Inside Passage.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>A NEW MODE OF TRAVEL.</h3>
</div>

<p>Their stay in Skagway was brief. It was
the point of parting between Colonel Snow
and his young charges, as it was necessary for
him to hasten a way westward to another part
of Alaska on his mission, which would occupy
some weeks. The boys parted with him reluctantly
and with some little feeling of homesickness,
but he promised to join them as early as
possible and assured them that he had placed
them in safe hands, with ample means for their
return to Skagway should sickness or accident
befall them.</p>
<p>Except for the brief glimpses of native and
local Alaskan life which they had obtained during
the stoppages of the steamer at Metlakatla,
in the Annette Islands, a reservation set apart by
Congress for the now civilized Tsimpsean Indians,
a tribe which, with their devoted missionary
head, William Duncan, immigrated from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
British Columbia to secure, it is said, greater religious
liberty, and at Ketchikan, a thriving
town, the boys here gained their first real impressions
of Alaskan conditions. They found Skagway
a town of about fifteen hundred people, set
in a great natural amphitheatre surrounded by
mountains capped with perpetual snow. It is
connected with the outside world by a cable to
Seattle, and by other parts of Alaska by telegraph,
and has electric lights and a telephone
system. A fine school building and several
churches that reminded the young Scouts of many
Hudson river towns, and wiped out the last remaining
evidences of homesickness, were among
the attractions, and the sight of a real railroad
equipped with locomotives, cars, shops and station
were among the marvels found where they
had expected to find a wilderness.</p>
<p>It was from this town that thousands of prospectors
and adventurers started in 1897 and 1898
in the rush to the Klondike, and Swiftwater
told them many stories of the terrible winter trip
over the White Pass in those years in which hundreds
of men lost their lives and thousands of
horses were killed.</p>
<p>With Colonel Snow they made one or two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
trips into the surrounding country, visiting the
nearby Chilkat and Chilkoot villages, during two
days that Swiftwater had gone over to White
Horse in Yukon territory, at the other end of
the White Pass and Yukon Railroad, a distance
of 112 miles, to make arrangements for boats
and Indian guides and boatmen to carry their
machinery into the wilderness. The boys were
greatly interested in this first near view of Alaskan
Indian life in the two villages which they
visited, and in comparing the natives with the
Indians with whom they had been associated in
their trip to the Canadian Rockies. The Alaskan
Indians were shorter in build, more squatty in
figure and broader faced than the Crees and the
other Southern red men. Jack, who had been
poking about into the various corners of the first
village, which were composed of huts and sod
houses, came back with a look very like disgust
in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Don,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;for goodness
sake don&#8217;t do anything to get adopted into this
tribe,&#8221; referring to an episode of their journey
in search of the lost mine, when Don had for
obvious bravery been made a fullfledged Indian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll na do anything to deserve it; it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
would be naething to be proud of. They do not
look much like our friends in Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two points in which I find they are
identical,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are those?&#8221; asked Rand, &#8220;color and
clothes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Jack, &#8220;dirt and dogs. The dirt
must have been here when the Indian came onto
this continent, but I&#8217;ve wondered whether the
Indian found the dog when he came here or the
dog found the Indian. They seem to have been
inseparable ever since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;D-d-do you s&#8217;pose they have dog days up
here so near the pole?&#8221; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Begorra, it looks to me as if all days might
be dog days around here,&#8221; suggested Gerald, who
was surrounded at that moment by at least a
dozen of the hundred animals in the village.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would be surprised to know,&#8221; said Colonel
Snow, &#8220;that the dog is really the most important
animal, except perhaps the reindeer in
our Northern possessions. Little of this country
would have been explored or settled except for
his good services. There was a time when as
much as two thousand dollars has been paid for
a good dog up here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>The Indians were persistent peddlers, offering
the handsome baskets, hats and blankets which
they are peculiarly skilful in making, and the boys
would have loaded themselves down with souvenirs
had not Colonel Snow suggested that they
would have plenty of time to supply themselves
before they left for the south again.</p>
<p>Two days later, Swiftwater Jim, having returned
from White Horse, and the freight having
been taken from the steamer&#8217;s hold, it was placed
on cars of the White Pass and Yukon Railroad;
the &#8220;piano case&#8221; as it had come to be called having
been put in storage until their return, and
early in the morning of a June day the boys bade
farewell to Colonel Snow and boarded the train
for White Horse.</p>
<p>The journey required nearly six hours, but the
first half was a stiff climb to the top of the pass
and through such magnificent scenery of mountain
and gorge that the boys scarcely noticed the
passage of time, beguiled, as it was, with thrilling
tales by Swiftwater Jim, with the story of the
fight of the Argonauts against the winter horrors
of this same trail in the early days of the
great gold rush.</p>
<p>They arrived at White Horse about four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, and were met by six
halfbreed Indians headed by a well-known guide
of that region known as Skookum Joe, who spoke
good English and greeted Swiftwater as an old
friend. He had been charged with securing the
crews for the two boats that Swiftwater Jim
was to use in the trip, and he introduced the men
whom Jim greeted in the &#8220;pigeon&#8221; Siwash of
that section, used as a means of communication
with the natives who do not speak English.</p>
<p>&#8220;I send up river for um,&#8221; said Skookum Joe,
&#8220;Dey know dat country. Good work when no
rum; rum, no work,&#8221; referring to the prevalence
of the liquor habit among the Indians since they
have come into contact with the whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;This here is going to be a traveling lodge of
the Cadets of Temperance, especially so far as
natives is concerned,&#8221; said Swiftwater Jim, &#8220;and
consequently everybody will work on this voyage.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the cases of machinery were removed from
the cars they were opened and the assembled
parts as far as possible taken to pieces. These
the Indians wrapped in heavy canvas, making
convenient bundles or &#8220;packs&#8221; for handling, and
obviating the necessity of transporting the heavy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
material of the cases. Bundled together the entire
freight was transported by teams to the water
front, where were tied up two commodious shallow
flat-bottomed boats into which it was loaded.
To this was added provisions sufficient for two
months, which Swiftwater had contracted for on
his previous visit to the town, and sundry tents,
tools and blankets.</p>
<p>Much of the clothing with which the boys had
provided themselves had been left at Skagway
as it was not needed for the present season. As
it was necessary to pay duties on the machinery
which had been brought from the United States
into the Canadian territory, and to give bond for
the two arms and personal equipment which was
to be taken into the woods, but eventually returned
to American territory, Swiftwater visited
the Custom House, and while there introduced
the Scouts to the Commissioner of Customs,
who spent part of the remainder of the afternoon
in showing the boys the town and the
natural beauties surrounding it.</p>
<p>Among other places they visited the barracks,
where they were introduced to the small squad of
Northwestern Mounted Police, the splendid organization
maintained by the Canadian Government
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
for the preservation of order in its western
and northwestern possessions. Its members are
recruited from among ex-soldiers of the British
army, with a reputation for hardihood and intrepidity
second to none.</p>
<p>The station squad, composed of four members,
received the boys cordially, and showed considerable
interest in the organization of the Boy
Scouts in the United States. Major McClintock,
head of the station, apologized for the necessity
of registering the young men at the barracks as
police regulations required.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a vast and wild territory, and we
police, who are responsible for law and order
here are few and far between. It is necessary
for the safety of all that we know as far as possible
just who the people are who come into
Yukon territory. Besides, this country is a
refuge for hundreds of men who find life unpleasant
in more civilized sections, and we must
keep them under supervision. By the way, I
have just received notification from the United
States marshal at Ketchikan that three queer
characters dropped off the steamer from Seattle
there and were heading for the Klondike, and
would probably pass through here, and he asks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
us to keep an eye on them. Thus far I have
seen nothing of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dublin, Rae and Monkey,&#8221; exclaimed Rand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh; you know them, do you?&#8221; said Major
McClintock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack here knows them very well,&#8221; said Dick
with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chance for more detective work, Jack,&#8221; urged
Rand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, he might join the Mounted Police,&#8221;
cried Gerald. &#8220;Major, won&#8217;t you give Jack a
chance with your troop?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys joined in the laugh, and Jack, who
had begun to enjoy the joke on himself, told
Major McClintock of their various encounters
with the three men, and all that was known of
their careers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the officer, &#8220;we&#8217;ll keep a sharp
eye out for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The head of the Mounted Police, who seemed
very familiar with the Boy Scouts of Great Britain,
told them something of the great organization
in England headed by General Baden-Powell,
with whom he himself had served in South
Africa.</p>
<p>As they bade him good night the Major said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
that the jurisdiction of his post extended over
the territory to which they were going, and that
some time during their stay there one of his
patrols would call on them.</p>
<p>At an early hour the next morning, Swiftwater
and the boys went down to the boats,
aboard which the Indian crews had passed the
night, and were there joined by Skookum Joe,
who was to go with them as far as the mouth of
the confluent upon which Colonel Snow&#8217;s land
was located, at which point he was to join a
steamer running on down the Yukon River to
Dawson.</p>
<p>They floated out upon the swift current of the
Lewes River, which many miles further away
is joined by the Pelly to make the Yukon, the
Behring Sea, some eighteen hundred miles away.</p>
<p>The passage down the Lewes was comparatively
easy except for the rapids through which
the Indian boatmen guided the flat-bottomed
craft by long steering oars, one at each end and
one at the side. Swiftwater had placed himself
and Jack, Don and Gerald in one boat, and assigned
Skookum Joe and Rand, Pepper and Dick
to the other.</p>
<p>The run through the small canyons and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
rapids was an exciting one to the boys, who were
unused to such rough waters, where it seemed
almost impossible at times to avoid the dangerous
rocks that reared their heads above the current.
By Swiftwater&#8217;s direction the boys were
allowed to take a hand at the oars at times, beside
the Indian oarsman, to accustom them somewhat
to the ticklish navigation of the rivers. While
they found the navigation something new, their
previous experience in canoe work had taught
them sufficiently &#8220;the feel of the water&#8221; to make
them fairly useful.</p>
<p>Pepper, who always threw a good deal of enthusiasm
into anything he attempted to do, was
barely saved from going overboard several times,
and when once left alone with the side oar, succeeded
in dipping the blade under a piece of hidden
rock and was thrown by the swift motion of
the boat high in the air, alighting somewhat
breathless on the mass of tarpaulined freight in
front of him, luckily without serious injury. The
oar, however, went by the board and was lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wh-wh-what was that?&#8221; gasped Pepper, as
he got his wind again and began to caress his
ribs where the oar handle had struck him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only got one guess,&#8221; laughed Dick, &#8220;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
I should say it was the bottom of the river,&#8221; while
Rand sarcastically suggested that it wasn&#8217;t part
of the business of this expedition to try and clear
the channel of the Lewes.</p>
<p>It was eight o&#8217;clock in the evening, and the
sun in that high latitude was still visible when
the boats reached the mouth of the stream known
as Gold Creek, which entered the Lewes from the
southeast. It was some miles up this confluent
that Colonel Snow&#8217;s land lay, and by direction
of Swiftwater the Indian boatmen skilfully
rounded the batteaus out of the current of the
Lewes into the Creek and into a little backwater
formed by a projecting sandy point between the
two streams. Here the water was fairly deep,
and as no trees came down to the water&#8217;s edge
two of the Indians held the boat up to the bank,
while the third sprang ashore with coils of rope
and two long iron stakes which he drove deep
into the gravel and sand, and tied the stern and
bow of the boat to the bank. The other boat
was fastened the same way, and Swiftwater,
springing ashore and stretching his long legs,
cried: &#8220;All ashore; we&#8217;ll make camp here, tonight.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>THE BIGGEST BEAR IN THE WORLD.</h3>
</div>

<p>As soon as the Boy Scouts had set foot on land
Swiftwater drew the boys about him and
assigned certain of the camp duties to each, directing
the Indians, however, to the heaviest tasks
of &#8220;making camp.&#8221; A large number of stones
were gathered at the highest point of the sand
and gravel, and a rough fireplace constructed.
Two of the Indians, under the direction of Rand
were sent across a short strip of meadow, which
intervened between the point and the adjacent
forest, for a supply of firewood. Rand took his
rifle along under Swiftwater&#8217;s direction, for protection,
and with the suggestion that he might
see something worth shooting, although he was
enjoined not to meddle with moose or caribou.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I think ye&#8217;ll see any,&#8221; said Swiftwater,
&#8220;for they&#8217;re mighty scarce here, but it&#8217;s a
poor time of year for the meat. Still, there&#8217;s a
few cats and other varmints in this section of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
the country that don&#8217;t like strangers, and they
make it lively for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the cats belong to the Indians?&#8221; innocently
inquired Jack, remembering the aborigines&#8217;
fondness for dogs.</p>
<p>Swiftwater laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never seen an Injun that cared to keep one
of &#8217;em longer&#8217;n he could let go of it,&#8221; said the
miner. &#8220;I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; of lynxes and the lou&#8216;g&#8217;rou
(loup garou), the Injun Devil, that is still pretty
thick in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indians who had come with the expedition
were no exception to fondness for dogs,
and had brought two shaggy, short-eared, long-nosed
brutes with them that had never barked or
uttered a sound except to snarl at any stranger
who came near them and absolutely refused to
make friends with anyone. One of these accompanied
Rand and the two Indians into the woods
and began nosing around in the bush and underbrush,
while the two men were engaged in cutting
light wood into short lengths and tying it
together in bundles.</p>
<p>They accumulated nearly two hundred pounds
apiece; loads that Rand doubted their ability to
lift, much less carry to camp. They were about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
ready to start back when there came from a
thicket forty yards distant a shrill scream that
sounded like a child in distress. At the same
moment the yelp of a dog was followed by a succession
of snarls and screams so nearly human
that Rand started toward the thicket crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, the dog is worrying a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, cat; killum malamute,&#8221; and with his axe
in his hand the Indian rushed ahead of Rand into
the thicket.</p>
<p>As Rand entered the brush the sounds of the
struggles and the snarls and screams were intermixed
with the loud commands of the Indian to
the dog. Rand raised his rifle as he burst through
the brush after the guide, and saw the dog and
a mass of gray fur mixed up in a writhing rolling
combat that tore up the grass and raised a
cloud of dust and mold and leaves. Before he
could get a chance at a shot the Indian had dashed
in and with a single blow of his axe had ended
the fight.</p>
<p>When the dog&#8217;s owner succeeded in separating
the dog from the dead animal, no small task, for
the former was made furious by the wounds he
had received, Rand saw the prey to be a short,
heavy creature with stumpy tail and tassled ears.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wild cat,&#8221; muttered the Indian, turning the
dead animal over with his mocassin, so that its
formidable claws could be seen, &#8220;easy killum
dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>Examining the wounds of the dog, which were
not serious, he pointed to the cat and administered
several severe kicks to the dog, which ran
snarling toward the camp, while the guide picked
up the body and returned to where his companion
stood fastening his bundle, having apparently
taken no interest in the contest. There was a
short exchange of gutterals and then each of the
Indians stooping down placed a band of strong
cloth around his forehead, slipped it under the
cord around the wood, and, with the aid of his
companion, easily raised it to his back and walked
off to camp as if it was a burden of no moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I see ye met up with a cat,&#8221; said Swiftwater,
as Rand and the Indians returned, &#8220;and
at that ye only got the smallest of the tribe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the others can fight any harder than this
specimen, I don&#8217;t believe I want to meet any of
them. I thought there was a child in the thicket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of these cat varmints have voices jest
like a human. Ye can&#8217;t tell a panther from a
squallin&#8217; child sometimes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>Bacon, canned beef, potatoes and coffee had already
been brought from the boats and the Indians
soon had a rousing fire which soon heated
the stones to red heat. Three of these had been
joined together to make a sort of three corner
oven and into this the potatoes were placed,
while over another portion of the fire the bacon
was fried and the coffee boiled.</p>
<p>A large tarpaulin had been brought ashore
and spread upon the sands, and upon this, or upon
stones placed thereon, the party seated themselves
and ate their repast from tin or thin wooden
plates. A day of excitement and vigorous exercise
had furnished them with strong appetites and
the rather coarse food of the camp was greatly
relished.</p>
<p>Arrangements for the night had been made by
raising a large tarpaulin over one of the boats
upon several of the crossed bars, forming a sort
of shelter under which were spread several of
the light mattresses that were part of the equipment;
and Swiftwater directed that the Scouts
should all &#8220;turn in&#8221; to this improvised barracks
together, while he and Skookum Joe retired to
the other boat. The Indians were given several
small canvas coverings known in the army as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
&#8220;dog tents,&#8221; and were to sleep around the fire,
which one of them was delegated to replenish
during the night.</p>
<p>The attraction of the big campfire and the
beautiful clear sky overhead filled the boys with
aspirations to &#8220;camp out,&#8221; and they were rather
inclined to grumble at Swiftwater&#8217;s orders compelling
them to sleep on the boat.</p>
<p>With the growing soldier spirit of the Scouts,
they resented being coddled, as Gerald chose to
express it, and he voiced the sentiment of the
patrol when he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t we sleep by the fire, Swiftwater?
I feel as if I was being sung to and then tucked
in same as I used to be at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll have camping out enough before ye&#8217;re
through with the woods; and I&#8217;m not going to
take any chances with all that tundra over there,
and that swamp back beyond of starting the season
with six fine cases of malaria on my hands.
Until ye&#8217;re a little better acclimated and a little
more hardened, it&#8217;s better for ye to sleep with a
board or two under you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The good sense of the old scout&#8217;s argument as
well as a fine appreciation of the miner&#8217;s thoughtfulness
for their welfare led the boys to at once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
acquiesce, and Rand voiced their appreciation.</p>
<p>Although it was early in the season, and the
insect world had hardly awakened to life, there
were a sufficient number of mosquitos about to
remind the boys of Colonel&#8217;s Snow&#8217;s injunction
regarding the supply of nettings, and Jack, after
several vigorous slaps, murmured sleepily:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, that certainly sounded like a voice from
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got the good old Jersey accent,&#8221; replied
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight from the Hackensack meadows,&#8221;
said Rand, referring to the once most favored
habitat of the mosquito in the East.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hae ma doots,&#8221; said Don, &#8220;if that is a mosquito
I killed just noo. I think it was some new
kind of night bird.&#8221;</p>
<p>How long he had been asleep Jack did not
know, when he was aroused by the growling of
the two dogs on the shore, and crawled out from
under the tarpaulin. The night was clear, and
there was a fine starlight. In the East there was
the faintest glimmer of dawn. The fire on shore
had died down, but the embers still shone. The
Indian who had been on watch had risen from
his seat and followed the dogs, which had run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
growling up the strip of sand toward the meadow
which lay between the water and the woods. Evidently
there was some game in sight, and Jack
crawled back under the tarpaulin and grasped
his rifle, a Remington repeater. He did not
arouse any of the others as he had really seen
nothing, and was a little sensitive to possible ridicule.</p>
<p>He ran up the gangplank and stepped ashore.
The other Indians were still asleep and Jack took
the trail of the sentinel, whom he could dimly
see in the distance.</p>
<p>The latter turned as he heard Jack&#8217;s footsteps
on the gravel, and waited for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;No know,&#8221; replied the Indian, &#8220;maybe bear,
dogs no fight, only growl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dimly through the dawn Jack could make out
a black mass lumbering slowly down through the
meadow toward them. The dogs ran around it
in circles, merely growling and offering no attack.
At a word from the Indian, however, they
ran in snarling on the animal, which stopped, and
with a loud &#8220;woof&#8221; reared up on its haunches,
showing an enormous height.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bear; shootum,&#8221; cried the Indian, who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
only an ax with him. Jack raised his rifle and
fired, and as the bear dropped on all fours fired
another shot.</p>
<p>The animal let out a snarling cry, and, grasping
one of the dogs which had ventured within
reach of its enormous paws, squeezed the life out
of it before it could let out a cry. The Indian
gave a yell and ran in on the enormous animal,
and with a well-directed blow of the ax split its
skull open between the eyes. At the same time
Jack, as a precaution, fired another shot into the
creature&#8217;s open mouth, and it rolled motionless on
its side.</p>
<p>The shots and the cries of the Indian had
aroused every one on the two boats, and Swiftwater
and Skookum Joe came running over the
sands, rifles in hand. By this time the early dawn
of the high latitude had rendered all objects visible,
and the boys had also joined Jack and the
Indian, who was circling cautiously around the
huge brute, trying to ascertain the fate of the
dog, which was still clasped in the death clutch
of the now motionless animal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha,&#8221; exclaimed Swiftwater, &#8220;a kodiak, and
a corker; the biggest one I ever saw. You fellers
were lucky to get him on the first shot, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
that breed can make an awful mess if they start
to fight. Hey, Skookum, catch hold and let&#8217;s
flop him over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having satisfied themselves that the bear was
dead, the miner and the guide, with the aid of the
Indians, moved the enormous mass which, with
the Indian&#8217;s blow, had slumped down upon its
hindquarters. With the greatest difficulty they
succeeded in straightening it out. The Indian
dog had been squeezed into a shapeless mass, and,
ascertaining this, the Indian gave it no further
attention for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty good thing you had a softnosed bullet
in that rifle,&#8221; said Skookum, pointing to the
gaping wound in the breast of the bear. &#8220;That
spread, and did the business right away. A steel
jacketed bullet would have gone straight through
and would not have done so much harm. Then
you might have been where the dog was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack, who had been seized with a sort of
buck fever after he realized what he had shot,
was trembling with excitement as he received the
almost envious congratulations of his friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Begorra, we&#8217;ll courtmartial you and drop ye
from the Patrol,&#8221; said Gerald, &#8220;if ye insist grabbing
all the glory for yourself this way. Why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
don&#8217;t you let us know when you are going out
after adventures?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, this is the second time that you have
gone knight-erranting by your lone,&#8221; said Dick,
&#8220;and I can see nothing for it. If this Patrol of
Boy Scouts is to get any chance to make a reputation
it will have to put Mr. Jack Blake on a
leash, and tie him to our wrists when we lie
down to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, if that big bear or whatever it is, is
really dead, ye&#8217;ve certainly made a better job of
it than ye did with Monkey,&#8221; exclaimed Don,
and, with the laugh that followed, poor Jack felt
that the ridiculousness of that episode on the
steamer had been practically wiped out.</p>
<p>Swiftwater and Skookum measured the huge
brown carcass that lay stretched on the sand before
them, and found it to be nearly ten feet
from tip to tip. They guessed its weight to be
about eight hundred pounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about the limit,&#8221; said Skookum, &#8220;tho&#8217;
I did hear of a skin once that measured thirteen
feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jack,&#8221; said Swiftwater, &#8220;you&#8217;ve killed
the largest meat-eating critter, in the world&mdash;carnivorous
I think ye call it. There&#8217;s none bigger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
than the big brown bear of Alaska. Some
say he isn&#8217;t so fierce as the grizzly, but he is
nearly twice as big, and there&#8217;s certain seasons
that he&#8217;ll fight at the drop of the hat, as the sayin&#8217;
goes. I never see one so far from the coast before.
He&#8217;s called a kodiak because he hangs out
down on Kodiak Island and on the Alaska and
Kenai peninsulas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Skookum Joe, &#8220;he likes salmon
better than a Siwash, and he set on the river
bank and fish for himself all day long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smellum salmon,&#8221; spoke up one of the Indians,
pointing to the fire where some skin of
the rough, Indian smoked fish had been thrown
by the aborigines the night before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wa-al,&#8221; said Swiftwater, with a grin at the
Indian, &#8220;I reckon they could &#8216;smellum&#8217; some o&#8217;
that seal oil o&#8217; yours down to Seattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indians set swiftly to work while the boys
looked on curiously, and soon had the enormous
brown hide of the animal off the body. The latter
they cut up and such portions as were available
they put aboard the boats. A few steaks
were cooked for the boys for breakfast, but, as
Swiftwater suggested, they found the meat dry
and tough and very lean. The Indians seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
to relish it, however, and the remaining dog ate
enormously.</p>
<p>Swiftwater promised Jack that as soon as they
reached their destination he would arrange for
the proper curing of the skin which he could
have as a trophy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;that goes to the Patrol for
the floor of our room back in Creston, and if
there is any glory attached to this matter that
don&#8217;t really belong to that Indian with the ax, I
shall be glad to hand that over to the Patrol.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they had all been aroused so early, Swiftwater
gave orders for an immediate start up Gold
Creek as soon as breakfast was over, that they
might get in a long day and possibly reach their
destination before night. Just as they were
aboard and were about casting off, one of the
Indians who had disappeared for a time came
running down to the water with a small bundle
of fur in each hand. One was the skin of the
wild cat killed the night before; the other the
skin of his dog crushed to death by the bear that
morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>INTO THE WILDERNESS.</h3>
</div>

<p>Skookum Joe, equipped with a dog tent
and some provisions, had been left on the
point of the junction of the Lewes River and
Gold Creek, to await the arrival of the down-river
steamer of the Yukon and White Pass Railroad
Company to arrive that day, and he waved them
a friendly farewell as the Indians slowly poled
their boats out into the stream. The current of
Gold Creek was by no means as swift as that of
the Lewes, and, while Swiftwater Jim took command
of one boat, Rand was made captain of
the other. Both boats had been built with narrow
walking boards along the sides after the
manner of the celebrated pole boats that plied on
the Mississippi and its tributaries in the upstream
journies in Lincoln&#8217;s time. One of the boys was
told off to work with the three Indians in each
boat for short stretches at a time, thus placing
two men on each side with poles about twelve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
feet long, while the commander of each boat
with a long oar gave an occasional impulse to
the direction in the way of steering, although
little of this was necessary. Two of the pole
men would start at the bow of the boat, placing
their poles on the bottom of the creek and walk
the full length of the &#8220;running board.&#8221; As they
reached the stern, two others would start at the
bow and walk down the boat while their predecessors
returned to the bow.</p>
<p>The Indians seemed to be able to continue this
performance without intermission, and feel no
fatigue from it, but the Scout who was detailed
to aid the Indians soon found himself suffering
from a peculiar aching in the side and back,
that Swiftwater described as the &#8220;Siwash Curve,&#8221;
due entirely to the fact that the white man in
poling up a river would exert himself in a way
that the average Indian considered unprofessional,
and would try to hold back, thus adding
to the &#8220;white man&#8217;s burden.&#8221; He insisted that
the white man usually got over this after the
first day&#8217;s work, and tried to make it pleasant
for the Siwash ever after. He limited the trick
of each boy at the pole for the first day to one
hour, and he himself and Rand took their own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
turns at the poles to relieve the aching and untried
muscles of the younger Scouts. Soon after
leaving the sandy banks and tundra of the lower
stream, the creek began to wind its way through
dense forests of spruce, poplar and oak with the
ghostly bark of the birch lighting up the dim
that marks the tangled wildwood of more southern
climates, showing how little the sunlight of
these northern climes penetrated the overshadowing
canopy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine woods for huntin&#8217;,&#8221; remarked Swiftwater
to Jack, as they poled slowly up stream,
&#8220;also for travelin&#8217; in winter. Bresh won&#8217;t grow
very far in from the streams this far north. Great
country for garden stuff howsomever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that vegetables will grow
this far north?&#8221; inquired the interested reporter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finest garden sass in the world in some sections.
Why, there&#8217;s a valley between the Yukon
and the Tanana, three hundred miles north of
here, that can grow anything but bananas and cocoanuts.
I&#8217;m told they grow bigger potatoes
and cabbages, and carrots and other plain, ordinary
cooking vegetables up there within a couple
of hundred miles of the Arctic Circle than
they do down in Oregon, where every man&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
truck patch looks like the floral hall at the county
fair when I was a boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can anything ripen in the short summers
up here?&#8221; asked Don.</p>
<p>&#8220;All vegetation has got to have light, and the
more it has the harder it will grow. Sun up
here is on the job all the time. Reminds me
of the year that I started out to be star performer
with old John Robinson&#8217;s circus back in Injianny.
Got up at three a. m. to help feed the animals and
hosses, and assist the chef in the cook tent; waited
on table for the canvas men and other nobility
from six to nine a. m., &#8216;doubled in brass&#8217; as the
sayin&#8217; goes, with the band, by carryin&#8217; the front
end of the bass drum in the gra-a-nd street parade,
wore a toga as a Roman senator in the great
entree, handled jugglin&#8217; and other apparatus durin&#8217;
two performances, and at midnight helped to
take down the big top. The other three hours
I had to myself. I don&#8217;t mean to say that the
sun up here in the summer time performs all those
gymnastics, but he works the same number of
hours and everything up here that wants to live
must keep right up with him. Ground is frozen
twenty feet deep, and thaws out about eighteen
inches in the summer time. That furnishes moisture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
Consequently, grass and vegetable are on
the jump all the time, working twenty hours a
day, and they manage to mature. Oats and other
grains that have to grow long stalks, I understand,
however, never top out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The work of poling the boats up stream was
varied at times by what Swiftwater described
as &#8220;canal work.&#8221; At stretch where the banks
of the stream were reasonably high and precipitous,
and the water of considerable depth close
to the shore, the three Indians in each boat fastened
themselves tandem to a long cable stretched
from the bow of the boat to the shore, and towed
the craft for miles at a time, while one of the
boys with the long steering oar kept the bow
away from the shore and headed up stream. This
method was considerable relief from the steady
poling which told perceptibly upon the back and
shoulders of the novice, and it formed a method
of rest for the Indians. The progress was about
three miles per hour, and the boys alternately
spent considerable time ashore, walking along the
banks and occasionally relieving one or two of
the Indians in the harness. The miner on the
occasion of these tows spent most of his time
ashore, directing the Indians and making frequent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
excursions into the neighboring forest with
one or the other of the young Scouts, examining
the timber and pointing out the peculiarities of
the different trees. He carried with him a repeating
shotgun, and was constantly on the lookout
for game, both birds and mammals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might run across a caribou,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I
scarcely think so this time of year. Besides, up
here he doesn&#8217;t take to heavy timber like this
same as he does in Maine and the Kanuck provinces.
He runs in droves of hundreds and thousands
up this way, and seems to like the scrub
timber.&#8221;</p>
<p>A short time before noon they came to a sharp
bend in the creek where the nature of the bank
hid the current ahead from the boys in the two
boats. Suddenly the Indians towing the leading
craft stopped, and as three held it against the current,
the leader of the team beckoned to Swiftwater,
who had fallen behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carry,&#8221; he said, briefly, to the latter as he
came up, and pointed to the stream ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;He means a portage,&#8221; said the miner to Jack,
who was walking with him, as they topped the
rise, they went forward to inspect the creek. Directly
in front of them where the stream had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
made a turn, the heavy timber of the forest had
retreated back from the water for several hundred
yards and the elevated shore sank to almost
the level of the water, and became half swamp
and half meadow, covered with tufts of grass,
and nearer the woods with a stunted growth of
brush and small dwarf birches. Gold Creek itself
spread out to nearly twice its former width, with
innumerable little sandbars and a few boulders
protruding from the bottom. Even Jack&#8217;s unpractised
eye could see that the current had no
depth of any moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stake out,&#8221; said Swiftwater to the Indians.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to portage.&#8221; The Indians at once
drove the steel anchorage stakes which they carried
into the soil and drew the bow of the boats
up against the bank and took similar precautions
with the stern of each. The Scouts had all joined
Jack and Swiftwater at the top of the bank, where
the commander of the expedition pointed out that
the widening of the Gold had so reduced the
depth of the channel that it would be impossible
to take the fully loaded boats over the route. As
a result most of the cargo if not all of it would
have to be unloaded, and perhaps &#8220;toted&#8221; around
the shallow to the deep water of the channel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A good deal of work, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; inquired
Dick.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no freighting de luxe up in this country
that I ever found,&#8221; replied the miner. &#8220;We
shall be lucky if we can get along without a
&#8216;carry.&#8217; First thing we&#8217;ve got to know is how
much water we&#8217;re drawing on each boat fore and
aft. Gerald, you&#8217;re nominated boat measurer,
and you can take Pepper with you. You will find
two or three lumber gauges in the dunnage in the
rear boat. Each of you take one, and let me
know at once what each boat is drawing. Rand,
you and Dick are leadsmen of this voyage, and
you will each take a pair of knee boots and a lumber
gauge and follow the channel of the Creek
from shore to shore and give me the greatest
depth of water you can find in a continuous channel
up to where the creek narrows again and the
water will naturally deepen. If you will wait a
few minutes we will give you the data to work
on. Jack, you and I will take up a job of stevedorin&#8217;
and get our longshoremen to work. You
take three of these Injuns and get to work unloading
this first boat, and I&#8217;ll take the others
and rustle cargo on the other. Most o&#8217; these
pieces can be jacked up the gangplanks, but where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
they&#8217;re too heavy in either boat we&#8217;ll call all hands
and get &#8217;em ashore.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time, Gerald and Pepper were armed
with two slim painted woodstaffs, not unlike the
wands of the Boy Scouts, but marked with figures,
and having at one end a movable arm
about two inches long that could be screwed fast
at any point. These they fastened at the extreme
end of each gauge, and hooked them under
the bottoms of the boats and marking the top of
the water were able to tell just what each boat
was drawing. They found, however, that the
boats did not trim exactly even, and that at one
point or another, bow or stern, the draught was
more or less by perhaps an inch. The general
average was about twenty-six inches in one boat
and twenty-eight inches in the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;These here ocean greyhoun&#8217;s had a displacement,
as they say in ocean goin&#8217; craft, of six
inches before they were loaded,&#8221; said Swiftwater,
&#8220;when I had &#8217;em measured in White Horse, and
if the channel anywhere above here peters out to
that it&#8217;s a case of carrying all this stuff around
this meadow land. If we can get even two inches
above that the job&#8217;ll be easier.&#8221; With the above
figures in mind, Rand and Dick plunged into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
shallows of the broad channel. Working from
rock to sandbar, and bar to boulder, they followed
the deepest pools in a tortuous path that
corkscrewed nearly from one shore to another,
and in an hour&#8217;s time were able to report to
Swiftwater that they could find passageway sufficiently
wide for the boats with a minimum depth
of fourteen inches.</p>
<p>When they made their report to Swiftwater,
a look of intense satisfaction crossed his face,
and he remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wa-al, I guess that cuts out one big engineerin&#8217;
problem that might o&#8217; kept us here a week.
Hustle that freight off; smallest pieces first.&#8221; The
channel figures were reported to Gerald and Pepper,
and they were instructed to measure frequently
the draught of the boats as the stuff was
moved ashore, and to report to the miner when
the draught was reduced to eleven inches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better be on the safe side,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Poor place to move freight if we should get
stuck out there through any mistake of our survey
men.&#8221;</p>
<p>So fast had the Indians worked while the leadsmen
were in the channel that it required but a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
few minutes more to reduce the draught of the
batteaus to the scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;S-s-say,&#8221; said Pepper with an anxious look,
&#8220;isn&#8217;t it a long time since breakfast? I can hardly
remember it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swiftwater grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It surely is, Pepper,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I guess
we&#8217;ll camp right now and do a little business with
the inner man before we go any further. I&#8217;m
apt to become int&#8217;rested at times, and forget all
about that other feller.&#8221;</p>
<p>At his orders the Indians constructed a small
fireplace, and the voyagers were soon sitting
about on the bank and boats enjoying with eight
hour appetites, strong black tea, ship&#8217;s biscuits
and canned baked beans, to which they did full
justice.</p>
<p>As soon as the meal was over, Swiftwater ordered
all six Indians to harness themselves to a
single boat, and placed Rand in it to handle the
steering oar while he himself waded along with
the Indians over the shallows to direct their
movements, Dick accompanying him to point out
the channel. The current was very sluggish, and
rapid progress was made over the half mile that
intervened before reaching deep water again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
Arrived at the desired point the boat was tied
to the bank and the remaining cargo quickly removed.
Then with all hands aboard, and poles
in hand the crew floated the scow back to their
former landing place. Here two of the Indians
were left to work with Gerald, Jack, Pepper and
Don in replacing cargo on the empty boat while
the other was towed up stream and unloaded.
The first trip had been so easy and successful that
Swiftwater told Gerald to allow a load sufficient
to give thirteen inches draught. The second boat
returning was loaded to the same capacity, leaving
still a small amount of cargo, requiring a
third trip for one of the boats. On this last trip
the boat also took in the boys, and as the Indians
had by this time learned the channel the
trip was made by poling without mishap.</p>
<p>By the middle of the afternoon the cargo had
all been replaced on the two boats, and the miner
announced that as they could not reach their destination
before dark they would make camp and
take the rest of the day to themselves. At this
point the forest came down close to the water&#8217;s
edge, and the ground was high and dry, and
Swiftwater told the boys to &#8220;camp out&#8221; if they
so desired, and had double tarpaulins placed on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
the ground for them and &#8220;dog tents&#8221; erected for
them near the Indians.</p>
<p>A roaring big fire was built, and one of the
Indians told off to keep it up. The Scouts
thought it was very soldierlike. They talked excitedly
for a while, and being weary fell into an
early deep sleep. Later there was a good deal of
restlessness and turning and twisting. Then
through the starlight, occasionally a mysterious
figure could be dimly discerned stealing silently
toward the boats. There was a quiet grin on the
face of Swiftwater, who had bunked on one of
the boats, when he arose at an early hour and
found three recumbent figures sleeping peacefully
on the comfortable mattresses in his own boats,
and on going ashore saw that the &#8220;dog tents&#8221; were
empty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite seasoned yet,&#8221; he said to himself,
as he quietly awakened the Indians.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>COLONEL SNOW&#8217;S RANCH.</h3>
</div>

<p>At an early hour that morning the journey
was resumed and their progress up stream
continued uninterruptedly until about the middle
of the forenoon, when Swiftwater stepped
ashore and began to search along the right bank
for landmarks. Suddenly, he stepped out of the
woods, and held up his hand and the Indians in
the first boat began to turn the craft&#8217;s head in toward
the shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; cried the miner, pointing to a
large board nailed across two small trees, under
which a &#8220;cairn&#8221; or pile of boulders had been
erected. &#8220;This is one of the corners of the Colonel&#8217;s
property.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boats were quickly fastened and the boys
tumbled up the bank with some curiosity to
investigate the site of what was for some weeks
to be a home to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Colonel told me,&#8221; said Rand &#8220;that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
had bought from the Canadian Government
about two thousand acres of the best virgin timber
of the British Columbia section, and this must
be some of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The site of their camp certainly bore out the
owner&#8217;s anticipations of the value of his purchase.
For miles in every direction stretched a solid
substantial growth of timber&mdash;hemlock, spruce,
fir, poplar and birch, towering to hundreds of
feet into the air, and many bolls five and six feet
through at the butt. There was very little undergrowth
and heavy turf extended in the long
aisles of the forest in every direction.</p>
<p>Within a very short time the boats had been
permanently fastened to the banks by heavy ropes
and strong stakes cut in the small timber, and
all hands began to unload the camp equipage.
From the bottom of one end of the craft where
the camp stuff and supplies had been piled, rough
boards which Swiftwater referred to as &#8220;sawed
stuff,&#8221; and which had been carried as a sort of
false bottom to the boats, were brought out and
made into a sort of platform roughly nailed together
and placed on a foundation of small boulders
gathered from the bed of the creek which
raised it a few inches from the ground. On this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
a heavy army tent, which had been brought from
White Horse, was erected by the Scouts themselves
and stoutly pegged and guyed in the most
approved fashion. A series of flies divided the
interior into rooms, and in these the camp bedsteads
were placed. This was to be the permanent
abiding place of the boys and the miner
while the work of preparing the sawmill camp
for the next winter&#8217;s work was going on.</p>
<p>The Indians were each given a dog tent and
two of the tarpaulins were turned over to them,
and at some little distance away they soon rigged
up something between a hut and a burrow of
stones, sods, and brush, about ten feet square,
the bottom of which they filled two feet deep
with spruce and fir boughs. Over all they drew
the tarpaulins and pegged them down. The boys
watched curiously the gathering of the fir and
spruce sprigs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes the finest spring bed in the world,&#8221;
said Jim. &#8220;I&#8217;ve slept on it hundreds of nights,
and there&#8217;s no mattress made that equals it. We&#8217;ll
make up some for ourselves within a few days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Preparations for the night having been made,
and a fireplace dug out of the bank of the creek
near the water&#8217;s edge, and walled up with stones
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
to some distance above the bank so that a perceptible
draft was obtained, one of the boys was directed
to bring from the stores a bright new copper
kettle with a porcelain lining and a tight
cover. Three flat stones were placed together
and formed a support for the pot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pepper,&#8221; said Swiftwater, &#8220;from this day to
the time we go out, you are to be captain of the
Kettle. You are to see that it is kept clean and
filled with clear water from the creek at least
once a day; that the water is boiled and that these
water jugs are kept filled and corked. I want to
ask the rest of you boys to drink, for a time at
least, nothing but the water that our friend Pepper
turns out; none from the creek. A man&#8217;s
health in a new country depends a good deal on
how the water hits him, and until you are acclimated
it is the safest thing.&#8221; The Scouts
readily promised to comply with the miner&#8217;s request,
and Pepper feeling that the health of the
camp was somehow in his charge felt not a little
elated. He issued orders at once for a supply of
firewood, agreeing to carry the water himself,
which he did, filling the kettle which held about
ten gallons. He put on so many small airs while
the boys were bringing in the firewood and arranging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
it beneath the kettle that they began to
dub him &#8220;Health Officer,&#8221; &#8220;Doctor,&#8221; and poke
fun at him in several ways. Finally Dick came
up and inspected the whole arrangement as if
he had never seen it before, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Grandma, makin&#8217; apple-butter or
quince preserves?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pepper turned red but went on poking the fire.
A minute or two later Gerald strolled by with:</p>
<p>&#8220;Auntie, can&#8217;t I have one of the doughnuts,
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still Pepper struggled to preserve his temper
and gave his whole dignified attention to his
new duties until:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma, how long fo&#8217; dat hog and hominy
fit to eat?&#8221; and Rand dodged a stick of firewood,
as the infuriated Captain of the Kettle turned
back to the simmering pot. He was undisturbed
for nearly an hour when Don strolled up with an
ostentatiously small armful of sticks and stayed
only long enough to ask:</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me that I smell braw parritch; or
is it kail-brose ye would be steaming there, gilly?&#8221;</p>
<p>Satisfied that a small conspiracy had been
hatched against him the ruffled Pepper bided his
time. Suddenly, Jack came hurriedly toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
him holding his nose and pushing him away
snatched off the cover of the kettle and yelled
dramatically:</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you so; I told you so; he can&#8217;t even cook
water; and now it&#8217;s all burned black.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shout of laughter that went up was the last
straw for the enraged Pepper and jumping on
his brother the two rolled over on the grass together
in one of those friendly tussles that had
been frequent incidents of their boyhood and that
always served to bring Pepper&#8217;s ruffled temper
down to normal temperature. Thereafter Pepper
insisted in supplying his own firewood and running
the kettle without help, and resented any
interference with his duties.</p>
<p>The days that followed were busy, but uneventful.
Swiftwater kept the camp busy at something
all the time and not many days passed before the
camp began to take on a look of permanency. He
set up first what he called a saw-pit, two big
&#8220;horses,&#8221; each made by driving fir poles into the
ground and crossing them and laying other sapling
across these. The two horses were about
seven feet high and twelve feet apart. From one
to the other of these ran a sixteen foot plank.
Spruce trees of medium size were then cut down,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
divided into sixteen foot lengths, and typo squared
with an ax. These timbers were then raised to
the top of the horses, and, while one Indian
mounted the log, the other stood underneath and
with a long gang saw &#8220;ripped&#8221; the timber into
deals or boards, thick plank or scantling as was
needed for camp use. As this lumber began to
pile up, he set the other Indians at work clearing
a place among the heavier trees, but not far from
the creek, for a sod house. It was to be some
twenty feet square and was to house Colonel
Snow&#8217;s lumbering gangs when they came in the
following winter.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tenting on the old camp ground,&#8217; &#8217;s good
enough, up here in the summer,&#8221; he said to the
boys, &#8220;but with the mercury loafing around sixty
below zero, canvas is no sort of shelter. A log
house is better but it is almost impossible to make
the caulking of that weather-proof.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sod houses are the invention of the pioneer
of the plains whose chief recreation was going
twenty miles to look at a tree four inches through.
Of course if we had the time we could saw out
lumber enough to make a &#8216;camp&#8217; that would be
weather proof, but the sod house is insured against
fire, flood, lightning and wind and is as cosy as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
a cave; besides, it takes a shorter time to build,&#8221;
and with this the miner led the boys, with the
exception of Gerald, who was to keep camp and
oversee the four Indians left there, to the boats,
one of which the other two Indians had unmoored,
and when all were aboard, began to pole
upstream.</p>
<p>About a half mile above the camp the woods
receded from the creek and a broad stretch of
elevated meadow intervened. Early as it was,
the short grass was green and luxuriant, and what
surprised the boys more than any thing else was
the number, variety and size of the wild flowers.</p>
<p>All hands had been supplied with long handled
spades with sharp edges, and as Swiftwater
marked the turf out in strips five and ten feet long
by two feet wide, the boys quickly cut it out, while
the Indians with a hand barrow carried and loaded
it onto the boat. It was cut to the bottoms of the
grass roots and was found to be of unusual thickness
and tenacity, the ten foot lengths folding up
like matting without breaking.</p>
<p>The miner told the boys that its condition was
due largely to the shortness of the seasons; for
while the grass grew with remarkable rapidity, the
underlying roots decayed much more slowly than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
in lower latitudes, and in time made the turf a
tough mass of twisted roots that it was almost
an impossibility to separate. Hence it was much
better for their purpose.</p>
<p>They spent the greater part of the day at the
work, having brought food and water with them,
and when night came the boat was loaded as deeply
as was safe for her draught. She dropped
slowly down the stream directed by the Indians
and was soon tied at her old moorings.</p>
<p>During the day, what Swiftwater called &#8220;the
hold,&#8221; had been excavated by the Indians to a
depth of about eighteen inches over the entire
site of the proposed house, and this had been filled
in as solidly as possible with small boulders from
the creek. The crevices between the stones had
been filled with creek sand and the whole rammed
hard. On this a solid platform of two-inch planks
had been laid by the sawyers and at intervals of
three feet long, thin stakes, sharpened at the top,
had been driven deeply into the ground just at the
ends of the excavation. Thus all had been prepared
for the erection of the sod walls the next
day.</p>
<p>Early the next morning Jack, who had determined
to keep an eye on all the details of a sod
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
house in case he should ever want to erect one
himself, was wandering around the newly laid
foundation, when suddenly there came to his ear
a muffled buzzing much like the drone of a distant
grasshopper. &#8220;This sounds like real summer,&#8221;
said Jack to himself, instinctively looking
around for the insect. As he approached one corner
of the foundation, the sound increased in
strength, and less resembled the grasshopper than
something like the shaking of a bag of marbles.
One of the Indians was approaching the structure
and as the sound caught his ear he broke into a
run with a deep guttural exclamation, at the same
time motioning to Jack to keep away from the
foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snake,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mooch bad. Killum.&#8221;</p>
<p>He picked up a stake lying beside the platform
and began to poke around beneath it. As he
reached forward to push the stake underneath,
something struck like a flash at the back of his
hand, and at the same moment a large rattlesnake
uncoiled and slid from underneath the boards out
into the short grass. With a blow of the stake
the Indian broke the snake&#8217;s back and then began
to suck the two punctures on his knuckle, at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
same time keeping the hand tightly closed and the
skin drawn tight.</p>
<p>For a moment Jack was horrified. Then the
instincts of the Scouts and his quickly working
brain ran rapidly over the instructions of &#8220;first
aid.&#8221; With a shout that brought the other boys
and Swiftwater on the run he drew from his
pocket a small cord, doubled it into a slipnoose and
placing it on the Indian&#8217;s wrist drew it so tight
as to cut off the circulation. At the same time
he called to Rand to bring the medicine case. The
miner, as soon as he comprehended what the trouble
was, also disappeared in the direction of the
tent. When Rand returned he had in his hand a
solution of permanganate of potash and a vial of
strong ammonia. With each of these he saturated
the wound with some difficulty, however, as the
aborigine insisted for a time in keeping his lips
to the wound as his own theory of first aid. The
hand and wrist had now swollen so much that the
cord had practically disappeared in the flesh and
the Indian was evidently suffering much pain. At
this moment Swiftwater appeared with a small
gallon demijohn, from which he poured for the
Indian a large tin cup full of neat whisky. The
red man swallowed it without a quiver and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
miner poured out another of similar size which
the Indian also drank.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll fix him,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;but I&#8217;m very glad
you thought of that cord Jack or we&#8217;d have been
an Indian short. Those drugs you have will neutralize
the poison and I don&#8217;t know but they would
have been sufficient, but I&#8217;m takin&#8217; no chances.
This&#8221; (indicating the demijohn), &#8220;is the old reliable
snakebite cure, discovered by Columbus
when he discovered the rattlesnake over here and
my mind naturally reverted to it at the first jump.
The worst of it is that the Injun won&#8217;t be of much
use for a couple of days and I&#8217;m afraid all the
other Siwashes will quit work and go to huntin&#8217;
rattlesnakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The work of building the sod house began
soon after the morning meal, and by night had
made substantial progress. One of the side
walls was built higher than the other, and a roof
of rough boards was laid on top of thick planks
which formed the top course of the walls. On
this roof was laid a course of sod, the grass of
which began in a few days to grow lustily.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Taint everywhere,&#8221; said Swiftwater, with
a smile, &#8220;that a man can have his lawn on the
roof of his house.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>AN HEIRLOOM RETURNED.</h3>
</div>

<p>Rand, whose inquiring turn of mind was
scarcely inferior to that of Jack, but of a
more profound and less transitory nature, had
shown a strong interest in the Indian boatmen
from the beginning of their journey and had
struck up an especial friendship with the Indian
whose dog had tackled the wild cat and had been
later crushed by the Kodiak bear. The red man,
while not morose, was taciturn, and replied to
all questions with monosyllables and scarcely a
smile. He showed friendliness in other ways,
and as he became better acquainted with the boys
responded to the young Scout leader&#8217;s approaches.
Day by day and word by word he inducted Rand
into the mysteries of the &#8220;pigeon,&#8221; or jargon used
as a language of communication with the natives.
It was made up of half Siwash, half English
words, the latter so amputated and distorted as
scarcely to be recognizable. It was rather automatic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
in character, as it could be changed or
added to as circumstances required, and Rand
found it easy to use after he had mastered the
first few principles of it, if it may be said to have
had any.</p>
<p>One evening, after the day&#8217;s work was over,
Rand strolled over to the shack where the Indians
lived and found his erstwhile friend sitting
on a stone, engaged in slowly carving with
a sharp knife the soft wood of a sycamore spar
that had been carefully cleared of its branches
and smoothed to comparative symmetry. The
worker had begun at the butt end of the pole and
had worked his way carefully upward. The
carvings were weird, goggle eyed, snouted and
saw-toothed creatures, the like of which could
only have originated in the brain of the late Lewis
Carroll, who wrote &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; or
in the dreams of a Siwash nourished on smoked
salmon and rancid seal oil. Part of the carved
lines of one creature formed the features of another
(if they could be dignified by the name of
features), and there was a sort of artistic continuity
about the whole that aroused Rand&#8217;s interest
and admiration. At the butt of the pole
another Indian had begun with two or three bean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
tins filled with crude colors evidently made from
vegetable dyes, to paint the carvings already finished.
Rand pointed to the pole, and asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Totem,&#8221; grunted the Siwash. &#8220;Me chief.&#8221;
He further informed the young Scout that it was
his purpose to set it up in front of the camp. Just
then, Swiftwater came along and spoke to the
Indian in his native Siwash. The latter arose
and stood for a moment erect, with his hand on
his breast with so dignified an air that Rand
could scarcely recognize in the figure before him
the slouching round-shouldered aborigine, who
went daily, so stolidly, about the labor of the
camp. Swiftwater listened to the rather oratorical
harangue which the Indian delivered, smiling
at times, but giving the man respectful attention.
He even gave him half a salute, as he turned and
walked with Rand toward their own tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that we had with us a representative
of the old Siwash nobility. The tribal
relations of these people are pretty well broken
up since we brought our boasted civilization and
our whiskey up among their homes, and they
don&#8217;t recognize the authority of their head men
any more. They have &#8216;got onto&#8217; our most cherished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
principle that all men were created free
and equal, and the chiefs and their families have
to hustle for a living as hard as the lowest of
them. Still, they cling to their ancient dignities.
That totem he&#8217;s been carving is the insignia of
his clan or family, and as he couldn&#8217;t bring the
old family totem pole with him, he carves one
wherever he settles for a time, and sets it up.
You remember in old &#8216;Ivanhoe,&#8217; Front de Boeuf
and the Templar displayed their banners on the
castle walls whenever they came up for the week
end, and they really didn&#8217;t have so much on this
old rootdigger after all. I rather like his spunk.
Good family connections are really something to
be proud of if ye don&#8217;t let &#8217;em interfere with yer
business, and they don&#8217;t come visitin&#8217; too often.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something about the totem pole aroused Rand&#8217;s
imagination, and with the other boys he went
over to the shack to look at the &#8220;work of art&#8221; as
Jack insisted on calling it. Although the boys
had seen totem poles in the city museums, and one
or two on their original ground in the Alaskan
villages that they had visited, there was something
familiar about this one. As they went
over the various figures, trying to distinguish
them from each other and speculating on what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
they were supposed to represent, Pepper, who had
been inspecting the upper part of the work, where
lack of color made the figures less conspicuous,
suddenly exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;S-s-say, this fellow&#8217;s family isn&#8217;t so very old.
Here&#8217;s the ace of clubs, and that couldn&#8217;t have
got over here before Columbus, and he didn&#8217;t
come up this far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said Rand. &#8220;Let&#8217;s look at it.&#8221;
Then, for the first time, the reason for the familiarity
of the design struck him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, boys,&#8221; he cried, excitedly, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
see it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; they cried in chorus, crowding
around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, and there. The top of this totem
is an exact replica of our narwhal horn.
Here&#8217;s the mammoth, and here&#8217;s the pile of
tusks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Begorra, that&#8217;s truth,&#8221; said Gerald. &#8220;Looks
as though he had copied it from our ivory. Run
and get it, Rand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young Scout leader, who had been made
custodian of the treasure, returned to the tent
and brought out the relic. It was a short, broken
piece of the twisted horn of the narwhal or white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
whale, discolored, and rubbed smooth as if with
much handling. It was covered with rude etchings
evidently made with flints or sharp shells.
As nearly as could be made out, the figures represented
a mammoth, an extinct creature of the
elephant tribe, a man beside a dogless sledge, a
pile of mammoth tusks, and a high cliff with an
opening or cave at the top whose mouth was
shaped like the ace of clubs referred to by Pepper.</p>
<p>With the greatest care the boys went over the
lines of the graven ivory comparing the figures
with the carvings of the hieroglyphics which the
&#8220;chief&#8221; had carved on his totem pole, and found
them to be almost identical, except for a few
minor particulars caused by the relief work on
the totem, and less crudity in the carvings.</p>
<p>The Indians at this time of day were engaged
at their work of sawing lumber and in finishing
the foundations of the sod house, where a ditch
was being dug, but it being near the hour of
noon the man who had described himself as a
&#8220;chief&#8221; came to the shack to arrange for the
noonday meal.</p>
<p>The boys turned to greet him as he came up,
and Rand drew his attention to the ivory, intending
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
to indicate the resemblance of the two carvings.
As his eye fell upon the relic a remarkable
change came over the Siwash. He reached forward,
and his eyes blazing with excitement, almost
tore the ivory from Rand&#8217;s hand and
stepped back in a defiant attitude.</p>
<p>Heretofore, the tones of the Indians, like those
of their dogs, had been low, guttural and subdued.
Now the aborigine gave vent to a shrill
piercing yell, and, at the same time, waved hysterically
to his comrades, all five of whom
dropped their tools and rushed to the shack and
surrounded the chief.</p>
<p>With a wealth of wild gesticulation and deep
growling tones that at times rose to almost a
shriek in a higher note they examined the horn
and appeared to pay it the most awed reverence.
The Scouts seeing that they were so deeply interested
did not attempt to repossess themselves
of their treasure for some minutes, and then Rand
was met by a most firm refusal on the part of
the leading Indian to give it up.</p>
<p>The other Indians surrounded him in a defiant
attitude&mdash;the first sign of insubordination that
had yet appeared among them, and the boys seeing
that they had encountered a mystery which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
could not at once be unraveled, and that the relic
had some almost overpowering importance to
the Siwashes, determined to drop the matter for
the time being, and put it up later to the commander
of the camp.</p>
<p>The aborigines went back quietly to their labor
in the afternoon, and the boys who were at
work with the miner, laying out the foundation
for the sawmill, took occasion in the intervals of
their labor to tell Swiftwater the story of the
narwhal&#8217;s horn, and the incident that had taken
place at noon. The guide listened with close attention,
and at the finish of the incident his face
was rather grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk with that main guy Siwash, some
time this afternoon. Meantime, I wish you
would all leave this matter in my hands. It may
turn out to be of more importance to us than
we think.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Scouts readily agreed, and toward the
middle of the afternoon the miner left them and
strolled over to where the Indians were at work
on the sod house, and calling the &#8220;chief&#8221; to one
side walked away with him to the bank of the
creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack, when they were all together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
at one end of the foundation, &#8220;what do you think
of it? There seems to be more in that horn
than we thought when we decided to bring it
along with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Rand, &#8220;and we seem to be coming
out of the little end of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith,&#8221; exclaimed Gerald, &#8220;it looks as if that
Indian was going to hold on to our relic, and
the others seem as if they were going to stand
by him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They certainly have seen something like it
before,&#8221; commented Dick, &#8220;and maybe it&#8217;s worth
more to them than to us. It was only a mere
guess of ours, after Colonel Snow undertook to
interpret it to us, that there might be anything
behind it, and it was only because it had evidently
come from an Arctic country that we even
thought of bringing it along with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Rand, &#8220;that we shall have trouble
getting it back, and I, for one, propose that
we leave the whole matter in the hands of Swiftwater
and try and get the true inwardness of
the thing from him. It ought to be a good story
if we don&#8217;t get anything else out of it.&#8221; This
view was readily agreed to, and the afternoon&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
work was progressing satisfactorily when Don,
after deep thought, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been listening to this Siwash language,
and I haed me doots as to whether it was a real
language like Gaelic or English or just a rumble,
but when I heard that head man scream like a
white man I concluded that it&#8217;s got some elements
of a language.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conference between the miner and the
chief lasted for a half hour, after which the latter
returned to his work, and Swiftwater joined the
boys. His face was still grave, and simply remarking
that he would enlighten them at supper
when the afternoon&#8217;s work was completed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little bothered about this matter,&#8221; said
Swiftwater, after the evening meal was concluded,
&#8220;and would have given a good deal if it hadn&#8217;t
happened. My experience with savages the
world over has taught me that while you may
rob them and make war on them and get away
with it, that you cannot interfere safely with their
religions or their traditions. Not that we have
intentionally done so, but it may have an effect
after all.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chief told me a long story, a good deal
of which I couldn&#8217;t quite make out the sense of,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
but it seems that you boys have in some way
got hold of an ancient treasure of his tribe many
hundred years old, and considered in some way,
sacred. He says there were two of these relics,
that they were handed from generation to generation
and carefully guarded. At first they were
merely the record of a buried treasure, the wealth
of the northern tribes being the ivory of the walrus
and the narwhal and such tusks of the mammoth
as came to them through the melting of the
glaciers. The buried treasure was never found,
and the tradition finally became incorporated in
the totem or coat of arms of the tribe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many years ago this family of Siwashes was
raided by tall red Indians from the far southwest
and the family scattered, and many women and
children and much loot taken. These ivory relics
were among the loot, and have been simply a
legend of the remnants of the tribe ever since.</p>
<p>&#8220;The unexpected return of this relic has
aroused a new spirit in them, and I can see a
little offishness and suspicion. While I do not
expect any trouble from them I want to be absolutely
certain of them until we get this work of
Colonel Snow&#8217;s done, and as I say, I should have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
been better satisfied if the matter had not come
up at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to suggest,&#8221; said Rand, &#8220;that we
Scouts surrender all claim to the ivory, and tell
the Indians that they are welcome to the relic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That might be a good idea, and I will go
along with you and explain to the Siwashes that
it came into your hands accidentally.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys crossed over to the shack where the
chief sat smoking with the others. For some
reason all work on the totem pole had been abandoned
for that night at least.</p>
<p>Rand, in his newly acquired jargon, explained
to the aborigines that the Scouts desired to present
the heirloom to the tribe, and Swiftwater
supplemented this with a talk in the native tongue
telling just how the boys had come into possession
of the horn.</p>
<p>The Indians listened gravely, without expression,
except to nod eager assent to the offer of the
Scouts to relinquish the prized relic. The chief
even showed some cordiality, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! You come me potlatch,&#8221; which Jim
explained was an invitation to visit him at his
village on the occasion of a merrymaking similar
to a Christmas celebration.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>The Scouts retired that night full of the mystery
of the thing, feeling as if they had come,
somehow, into touch with a long dead past.
Swiftwater appeared more reassured, but took occasion
to visit the shack before turning in and
found the aborigines all herded together with
the dog in the almost air tight hut, ventilation appearing
to be a thing abhorrent to them.</p>
<p>The first thing that became apparent when the
boys and the miner threw back the cheesecloth
door of their tent that kept out the horde of mosquitos
in the early morning was the absolute silence
of the forest. The six Indians had taken
one of the two boats, and with the dog had silently
drifted away during the night down the current
of Gold.</p>

<p>The chagrin of Swiftwater Jim was almost
too great for expression when the discovery
of the Indians&#8217; desertion was made.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was what I had feared,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Still, I
thought our talk last night had absolutely satisfied
them. I don&#8217;t think they were so much afraid
of us as that they desired to be sure that the sacred
bone got back safely to their village, and
they knew that a big feast would be made for
them when they returned. It would be useless
to pursue them, for it would be a hard trip back
to White Horse, and there would be no certainty
of our being able to keep them if we got them
back. Our work here is so nearly finished that
I believe if we turn to it heartily we can complete
it in the time we intended and get back to Skagway
in time to meet Colonel Snow on his return
from the northwest. How about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Scouts, and especially Rand, felt themselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
to be to a certain extent responsible for
the situation in which they found themselves that
they readily agreed to turn to and exert themselves
to the utmost to finish up the work of preparing
the camp for the winter&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>The sod house had been practically finished by
the Indians before they deserted, the only thing
remaining to be done consisting of the hanging
of a pair of stout double doors on the casings
that had been let into the sod as the walls went
up, the finishing of the windows and the erection
of a chimney for the big fireplace that had been
built into the house at one end.</p>
<p>The doors had nothing artistic or ornate about
them, and in half a day were constructed of rough
lumber and hung on strong hinges from among
the hardware in stock. Instead of glass for the
windows, which hard freezing of the sod house
and settling of the walls might have a tendency
to shatter, double sheets of mica, such as is used
in the flexible tops of automobiles, were set in
and plastered with clay which was burnt to the
hardness and consistency of brick by a plumber&#8217;s
flash lamp sending out the hot flame of burning
gasoline in the hands of Swiftwater.</p>
<p>The construction of the chimney was a novel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
experience for the boys, who knew little of the
expedients that pioneers far from stone and lime
were compelled to resort to. It is true there were
many boulders in the creek, but skilled work was
necessary to lay them, and the miner resorted to
an easier method.</p>
<p>A considerable amount of lumber sawed by the
Indians remained, and this was split up into
stakes about two inches square. These were
driven into the walls of the house alongside of
the fireplace and other stakes laid across them at
their outer ends.</p>
<p>As fast as this structure became a foot high it
was plastered inside and out with clay which
was burnt hard with the blow lamp. Above the
opening in the fireplace the chimney was continued
by putting of clay on the sod wall and
burning it in, making the chimney smaller for
better draft.</p>
<p>The top of the chimney above the house was
provided by constructing a cratelike affair by
fastening smaller pieces to four stout stakes and
setting these stakes down into the chimney and
plastering the whole inside and out with clay.
After a hot fire had been kept up in the fireplace
for twenty-four hours to thoroughly bake the clay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
Swiftwater announced that the sod house was
finished.</p>
<p>This work was not accomplished without some
inconvenience, and even suffering to the boys as
yet scarcely inured to hard labor. Blistered hands
and aching backs were the daily portion, and it
was only by working them in shifts of three that
the miner was able to gradually break them in.
But pure air and good food worked wonders, and
in a few days they hardly felt the effects of a
day&#8217;s labor except in increased appetites and
sound sleep. As the days went on, however, the
small pests of wood and water that come with
the summer increased in number, and almost
drove the boys frantic. The mosquito seemed to
be always present day and night, and despite the
use of nettings and cheesecloth it seemed almost
impossible to keep them out of the tent. A worse
plague if possible was the &#8220;black fly,&#8221; a minute
midge that bored deep into the skin and brought
the blood with every bite. There was also in
lesser numbers a large striped fly that had a
habit of hanging on the spruces and birches in
clusters, but came at once to welcome the white
man as an old friend.</p>
<p>His bite was like the cut of a knife. Swiftwater
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
said he had never been able to discover what this
fly lived on when the white man was not there,
for it is matter of record that it would not touch
an Indian or an Eskimo.</p>
<p>As it became necessary to protect one&#8217;s self
against these tiny marauders, Swiftwater dealt
out to the boys small vials of a swarthy looking
mixture compounded of oil of cedar, oil of tar
and pennyroyal. With this they bathed their
faces and hands frequently, which had the effect
of discouraging the pests and greatly reducing
their attacks. The mixture entered the pores of
the skin, however, and it was not many days before
everyone of the Scouts was as tawny colored
as the Siwashes who had left them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not the only Injun in camp, now,&#8221;
said Jack, addressing Don, who had been adopted
into a tribe of Crees in the Canadian Rockies.
&#8220;If this Patrol should step into an Indian village
now we&#8217;d be adopted offhand on our complexions
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m na so certain,&#8221; replied Don, &#8220;but I think
I could get along the rest of my life in comfort
if I never smelled pennyroyal again. &#8217;Tis not a
perfume that grows on ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly has grown on us the last week,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
said Rand, &#8220;and I notice that lately the mosquitos
seem to be taking a liking to it. At least they
don&#8217;t seem to mind it as they did at first.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true that the insects seemed to be growing
larger and fiercer as the summer advanced,
and it became essential to secure better protection
for the workers in the daytime. The miner
brought out a half dozen ordinary linen hats,
and cutting up sufficient netting for the purpose
with his sailor&#8217;s &#8220;palm,&#8221; sewed it around each of
the headgear. This, when placed on the head,
allowed a fall of netting to drop down on the
shoulders, protecting the face and neck. This
was found to be a great protection, and as the
boys had grown somewhat hardened to the stings
they got along very nicely.</p>
<p>The next job undertaken was the foundation
for the sawmill itself. For this purpose, Swiftwater
had brought along some bags of cement,
and a small excavation similar to that made for
the house was dug about eighteen inches deep and
filled with boulders rammed in with clay. On
this a wood fire was built, and the clay burned
hard, resting on this around the edges a form
of boards was placed, making a sort of bottomless
box. The cement, mixed with sand and water
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
from the creek, was made into a concrete which
was poured into the form upon the baked clay
and boulders. The plastic mass when it filled the
boxlike structure to the top was smoothed off and
allowed to dry. Forty-eight hours after it had
hardened into stone and the foundation was complete.</p>
<p>The camp duties devolved upon the Scouts as
well as the hard labor which had been a legacy
from their Indians. The miner divided up these
duties as best he could, making Rand responsible
for the sanitary condition of the place, and giving
such hints as he himself had gained by a service
as an enlisted man in the army and as a shipmaster.
He himself took upon himself most of
the cooking, although when the ship&#8217;s bread they
had brought with them began to pall upon the
boys he selected Gerald for baker, and taught
him how to mix a batch of baking powder bread,
and bake it in a &#8220;reflector&#8221; before an open fire.</p>
<p>The first batch of loaves that Gerald produced
came out of the little oven so dark colored and
hard, as they had failed to rise sufficiently that
they could not be eaten, and aroused the jeers
of the &#8220;baker&#8217;s&#8221; fellow Scouts, who used them
for several days in a game of basketball until Gerald
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
sneaked them out of camp and threw them
into the creek. He had excellent results with the
bakings which followed, and after the chimney on
the sod house was finished a fire was built in the
new fireplace that gave a steadier heat, and he
even attempted a batch of biscuit with such excellent
results that they informed him they were
as good as any &#8220;that mother used to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swiftwater was indefatigable in his attention
to the diet and health of the Scouts, and made an
effort to vary the former as much as possible.
Most of their food was canned or cured provisions,
and the miner did his best to secure fresh
food. After the adventure with the bear no large
game was seen at all, but occasionally small birds
were shot, and squirrels were found fairly abundant.
These, with a few small trout caught by
Pepper in the creek, helped to form a pleasant
change from bacon, canned beans and what the
former sailor called &#8220;salt horse,&#8221; or corned beef.
The commander of the camp was especially anxious
to get hold of some green vegetables, but
the time was too short to attempt to grow anything,
and he spent some leisure time in the woods
trying to find some substitute. A change to green
stuff is found very essential on shipboard to prevent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
certain diseases that follow a too steady diet
of salt and canned foods, and the alternative where
vegetables are not obtainable, is lime juice, occasional
doses of which the miner administered to
the boys.</p>
<p>One Saturday Swiftwater suggested a half
holiday, and with the remaining boat pole up to
the meadow where they had obtained the sod,
and search for some wild vegetables of an edible
character. It was also suggested that as the May
flies had begun to appear the party should take
their fishing tackle along and run a few miles
further up the Gold and try casting off for the
handsome, brown, steelhead and brown trout that
frequent the interior waters of the British Columbia
region, especially near their mountainous
sources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better take some larger tackle and
try for salmon?&#8221; suggested Dick. &#8220;I understand
this country is famous for salmon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, hardly,&#8221; replied Swiftwater. &#8220;If we
were on waters that flowed into the Pacific and
Alaskan waters we should probably find them.
But the rivers hereabouts rise in the Coast range
mountains which separate us from the sea and
flow northeast. The salmon is not a fresh water
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
fish. He lives in the most remote depths of the
ocean, and only runs up the rivers during the
summer to spawn, and usually dies there. He can
climb a pretty high waterfall, but I don&#8217;t think
he could climb the Coast range to get into Gold
Creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>As this was the first outing they had had it was
decided to take sufficient provisions and firewood
with them to last until the next day and stay
over night if they found encouraging fishing up
the stream, and to return before dark on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I like to make Sunday a pretty good
day, when I can,&#8221; said the miner, &#8220;I think that
our necessity for fresh fish and vegetables makes
this trip a work of necessity.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was decided that two of the boys should
stay and guard the camp, and Rand and Jack
expressed a willingness to do so when they
saw that Pepper and Dick were both anxious to
get away from the monotony of the place they
had been tied up to for weeks. So with Swiftwater
and Gerald poling on one side and Don
and Dick on the other, and Pepper at the long
steering oar in the rear the boat was pushed off
into midstream with a bugle Scout salute from
the garrison left behind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>The day was beautiful, and nearly as warm as
midsummer in New England. The trip up to
the meadows would have proven uneventful except
for the unparalleled energy of Pepper, who,
as Dick said, was &#8220;always sticking his oar in at
unexpected times.&#8221; As the boat steered easily
he attempted to aid the polesmen by pushing at
times with his long stern sweep, until at an unexpected
moment the blade of the oar slipped
between two rocks and down into the soft bottom
and stuck there straight upright, dragging the bewildered
Pepper, who clung to it, completely off
the stern of the boat.</p>
<p>The frightened young Scout, not knowing how
deep the water was under him, wrapped his legs
around the sweep which remained upright, and
clung to it yelling for help.</p>
<p>The impetus of the boat carried the craft on
about twenty-five feet before it was stopped by
the current, for the polesmen had stopped work
and turned around to whoop with laughter and
delight when they saw the ridiculous figure
perched on the oar in midstream still crying for
rescue.</p>
<p>Shouting words of encouragement they let the
boat drift slowly down stream again. Before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
they reached him, Pepper&#8217;s strength gave out,
and he slid slowly down the sweep, and was preparing
to battle for his life in the icy water when
his moccasins brought upon a rock in a foot of
water, and he pulled the oar loose, and as the
stern of the boat reached him stepped aboard with
a foolish expression on his face, barely wet to
the knees.</p>
<p>It would be cruel to Pepper to record in this
history the sarcastic expressions of admiration
for his agility and ability &#8220;to reach out and grab
trouble every time it went by,&#8221; as Dick expressed
it. There were references to the &#8220;champeen pole
vault of Alaska; height ten feet; depth, twelve
inches,&#8221; &#8220;veteran oarsman of the Gold,&#8221; &#8220;Rocked
into the Cradle of the Deep,&#8221; but the last comment
which brought out the old Pepperian red
through the tan and the yellow of the mosquito
&#8220;dope&#8221; was a quotation from an old boyhood
rhyme made by Gerald, apropos of &#8220;appearances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arrived at the meadows they found the grass
grown to the height of their heads and a wealth
of wild flowers such as they had never seen before.
Acres of yellow poppies, wild geraniums,
bluish in color, saxifrage, magenta colored epilobium,
moccasin plants and a hundred others with
familiar faces. But what pleased Swiftwater especially
were the immense quantity of dandelions.</p>
<p>He set the boys at work gathering all the plants
they could secure, while himself began to hunt
for a peculiar wild onion, which he finally found
in abundance. He also found sorrel, both the
tops and root of which are pleasant to the taste.
They half filled the boat with these and other
harmless edible plants, and then late in the afternoon
started to pole up the river to the fishing
grounds, intending to try for the trout in his
most amenable season, the early evening.</p>
<p>After the boat had pulled away from the
camp, Rand and Jack cleared up the remains of
the dinner and put things to rights, after which
Rand said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Jack, I&#8217;m going to indulge in a little
luxury&mdash;a hot bath. This bathing in the creek
is all right, but that water feels as if it came right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
out of the snow, and I can&#8217;t get it to take hold
on this &#8216;dope&#8217; stain on my skin at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you going to do it? We didn&#8217;t include
anything like a bathtub in our luggage you
know, and we haven&#8217;t anything big enough to
heat more than a few gallons of water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you; give me a hand and I&#8217;ll rig up
a bath big enough for both of us.&#8221; They went
to the tent and got the biggest of the tarpaulins
lying there, and taking it to the two
seven-foot sawhorses which the Indian sawyers
had used. Placing the two close together they
threw the ends over the horses and fastened them,
allowing the middle to hang down almost to the
ground. By drawing the sides a little tighter
than the middle of the ends, they formed a sort
of loose bag. While Jack made up a hot fire in
the fireplace, into which he dumped a dozen boulders
from the creek, Rand carried water enough
to fill the &#8220;bath tub&#8221; in the tarpaulin, the texture
of which was so thick and so closely woven that
very little of it dripped out. As the boulders became
red hot, Rand and Jack brought the hand
barrow used to cart stones from the stream, with
a little sand in the bottom, and rolling the stones
into it carried them to the &#8220;tub&#8221; and dumped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
them in. They soon had the water at a boiling
heat, and quickly stripping both tumbled in and
were soon luxuriating the first hot dip they had
enjoyed since leaving the hotel in Skagway.</p>
<p>They were engaged in an effort with strong
soap and sand, trying to remove their lately acquired
complexions, when the sound of oars and
poles on the river reached them. They were considerably
back of the camp in the timber, and
could not see the landing from the &#8220;bathroom,&#8221;
but supposed the sounds were by their comrades
returning. They stepped from the tarpaulin to
go to the creek for a cold plunge as a finishing
touch, when over the bank swarmed the six Siwashes
who had so lately deserted them. They
were unarmed and were driven by three men with
guns. The two boys seeing the strangers were
about to step aside for their clothing when they
were ordered to stand and throw up their hands.
The three newcomers were Dublin, Rae and
Monkey.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>AT THE MERCY OF THE PEST.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Sorry ye&#8217;r not in receivin&#8217; costume, but
that won&#8217;t make no difference. We got
off down to the mouth of the creek when the
steamer went down and started to walk up when
we met these Siwash comin&#8217; down with the boat,
and concluded it was just what we needed. We
held &#8217;em up, and finally persuaded them to pole
us back up. They wouldn&#8217;t talk much at first,
but finally told us what ye were doin&#8217; up here.
We intended to git here at night and su&#8217;prise ye
a little, but when we stopped at the bend just
below we saw the other fellers pushin&#8217; up stream,
and concluded to come right on and su&#8217;prise ye
this afternoon. Rae, you and Monkey herd them
Injuns into that shack over there, and let Monkey
stand watch on them. Then you come back here
and we&#8217;ll take care of these young Scouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing up here?&#8221; asked Rand.
&#8220;What do you want of us?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re after part of the outfit you
brought in here, for we&#8217;re goin&#8217; on down the
Yukon prospectin&#8217;. Then I think there&#8217;s some
of that machinery you brought in that Colonel
Snow would pay pretty heavy to git back, and
we&#8217;ll annex some of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; snarled Rae, who had returned, &#8220;and
first thing we&#8217;ll put you two where you won&#8217;t
bother for a while. I&#8217;ll git some rope,&#8221; and so
saying, he turned toward the tent and soon returned
with some cord.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Dublin,&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;Whatever
you intend to do let us get on some clothing, for
these mosquitos and black flies are torturing us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haw, haw,&#8221; yelled Rae, &#8220;that won&#8217;t do you
any harm. Let&#8217;s tie &#8217;em up just as they are
and let the bugs chew on &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, man,&#8221; protested Rand, &#8220;they would
torture us to death in a few hours. Do you want
to murder us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I ain&#8217;t so pertikler,&#8221; sneered Rae. &#8220;You
fellers have made us trouble enough around Creston,
and ye&#8217;ll have to take yer chances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, cut that out, Rae,&#8221; said Dublin, in
whom, despite his criminal instincts, there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
still many elements of decency. &#8220;We&#8217;re not here
to murder anybody. Git them some clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a growl, Rae limped away to the tent
again, returning with two pairs of pajamas, and
despite the boys&#8217; complaint that these would
prove but little protection, they were compelled
to don them. Their hands were then bound, and
they were then taken a short distance back into
the woods, where they were fastened to trees.
Then the desperadoes went back and began to
ransack the stores. Ripping open boxes and bags
they piled up a varied quantity of provisions, and
even helped themselves to a quantity of clothing
and blankets which the expedition had brought
up to be left in cache for the following winter.
They also tore open the canvas coverings of the
sawmill and a dynamo which accompanied it,
which was intended to supply electric light for
night work to supplement the short days of winter.
From both of these they selected a dozen
of the smaller parts of the greatest importance
and made one canvas bundle of them, thus disabling
the machinery completely.</p>
<p>Having gathered their loot together they went
to the shack and compelled three of the Indians
to come out and carry these things and place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
them aboard the boat. They had worked nearly
two hours, and now cursing the Siwashes, they
urged them to hurry with the plunder, fearing the
return of the other members of Swiftwater&#8217;s
party.</p>
<p>Meantime, the boys had been suffering tortures.
The woodland pests of all kinds swarmed
about them, stinging through the thin clothing
and covering their heads and faces, which had
now begun to swell to an extent that threatened
total blindness in time. Fortunately, the gang
had not gagged them, and they were able to comfort
one another with the hope that their comrades
would find no fishing and return that night.
They made desperate effort to release themselves,
but with no result except to chafe wrists and
ankles to a painful condition. The place where
they had been fastened was further up stream than
the camp, which was partly concealed from them,
but commanded a view of a mile or more up the
creek. As time went by they scanned this stretch
of water eagerly for some signs of their friends,
but in vain. At last, Jack, who had tried to bear
up bravely as became a good Scout, spoke up in
rather a tremulous voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Rand, do you suppose they will go away and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
leave us tied up like this all night? These mosquitos
will come in clouds after dark, and we
can&#8217;t last long then. One of my eyes is about
gone now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rae and Monkey might do it, but I am sure
Dublin will see that we are cut loose,&#8221; replied
Rand.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Rand, who had been straining his
eyes up the stream, exclaimed excitedly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, Jack! There&#8217;s some one coming down
the creek on the shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack turned eagerly to the shore above. Sure
enough. Three figures on horseback had just
emerged from the forest, but a hundred rods
above them, and rode slowly down the bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t see us yet,&#8221; said Rand. &#8220;Wait
until they get about half way here, and then yell
for help with all your might.&#8221;</p>
<p>The horsemen rode slowly toward them, and as
they reached a point a few yards distant both
Rand and Jack let a high boyish scream with all
their strength:</p>
<p>&#8220;Robbers! Thieves! Help! This way.&#8221;</p>

THEY RODE STRAIGHT FOR THE BOYS.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>At the same moment the three strangers caught
sight of the two queer figures tied to the trees
and pulled up a moment. With the first yell, Rae
and Dublin came running around the sod house
with their guns leveled, cursing the boys and commanding
silence. At the same moment they
caught sight of the strange horsemen. They
turned at once and ran back for the shack just
as the horsemen seemed to comprehend the situation.
There was a sharp bugle call, and the
three put spur to their horses, and with carbines
in rest came on at a hard gallop. They had to
come round a little bend in the creek which delayed
them a little, then they rode straight for the
boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind us,&#8221; cried Rand, &#8220;get that gang
before they get away. They&#8217;ve been raiding the
camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two of the men turned and rode around the
sod house while the other with a spring from
his mount and with a couple of slashes of a big
wood knife cut their bonds, and remounting, followed
his comrades without asking a question.</p>
<p>The boys followed as rapidly as possible, and
when they came into view of the camp a curious
and lively scene met their gaze. Dublin and Rae
had gotten the Indians out of the shack and at
the point of their guns had herded them toward
the boat into which they were tumbling as fast as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
they could. The horsemen were riding toward
the struggling crowd crying out to them to halt.
As they rode near, Dublin and Rae turned and
deliberately fired at the men, whose carbines at
once cracked in reply. The last of the Indians
who had not yet gotten into the boat pitched forward
on the bank, and jumping over him, Dublin
and Rae gave the boat a push out into the middle
of the stream, sprang aboard and dropped into
the bottom of the craft, which at once began to
drift down with the current. As nothing was
in sight above the gunwale except the Indians the
horsemen did not fire again. As the batteau
drifted around the point, Monkey Rae, who had
been the first to get aboard and conceal himself,
rose, and putting his fingers to his nose, shouted
back some insulting epithets.</p>
<p>Having dismounted, the three strangers turned
to meet the boys, who at once recognized in their
khaki uniforms, blue flannel shirts and broad-brimmed
hats, three of the members of Major
McClintock&#8217;s patrol of Royal Northwest Mounted
Police, whom they had met in White Horse.</p>
<p>They saluted the boys, who returned the recognition,
and then shook hands with their rescuers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, it seems we were just in time,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
O&#8217;Hara, the sergeant, &#8220;but I&#8217;m sorry we didn&#8217;t
get that crowd. If I&#8217;m not mistaken, it&#8217;s one the
Major has been looking for that came up on the
same boat from Seattle with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rand assured him that the desperadoes were
the same that had been referred to, and he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know how they got by our
post at White Horse, but they must have made
a circuit. However, our men&#8217;ll get thim somewhere.
How are ye yerselves? Begorra ye have
foine lookin&#8217; faces on ye. Wait till I docther
ye up a bit. We all get lukin&#8217; worse than that
sometimes on this patrol duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>He produced from the haversack or his &#8220;war
bag,&#8221; as he called it, at the rear of his saddle, a
couple of bottles, one of which contained water
of ammonia and another glycerine and vaseline
mixed. The application soon relieved the pain
and reduced the swellings. As he did so the other
policemen walked down to the landing, where
they were attracted by groans at the foot of the
bank, and there found the Indian who had pitched
forward when they had fired, and whom they supposed
had been dragged into the boat. Instead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
he had rolled down the bank and partially into the
water.</p>
<p>They picked him up and carried him up onto
the grass, where the boys at once recognized him
as the Siwash chief who had deserted at the head
of their Indians a few days before.</p>
<p>An examination showed that one of the police
bullets had gone through his thigh, but had not
made a dangerous wound. Rand at once dressed
this, at the same time having some talk with him
in &#8220;pigeon.&#8221; The chief could add but little in
his jargon to what Dublin had already stated&mdash;that
they had been met at the conjunction of the
Gold and the Lewes by the desperadoes, and under
cover of the rifles been compelled to return
up stream. Of the narwhal&#8217;s horn he refused to
talk, and his wound having been dressed he was
placed on the balsam boughs in the shack.</p>
<p>Rand and Jack at once extended the hospitalities
of the camp to the mounted police, who
gladly accepted the offer of the empty sod house
to stable their mounts, and thus kept them from
the attacks of the insect pests. They also showed
extreme satisfaction at a rather elaborate camp
dinner gotten up by the boys in their honor as a
relief from the rather limited army rations that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
constituted their portion when riding over the
long trails of the &#8220;beat&#8221; which they covered four
times a year.</p>
<p>The evening was spent around the camp fire;
the boys giving an account of the work that they
had done since they left White Horse, and the
troopers relating many wild and hazardous adventures
of the lands above Winnipeg, including
the forests, the posts of the Hudson Bay Company,
the &#8220;land of Little Sticks,&#8221; and the &#8220;Great
Barrens&#8221; that stretch north to Hudson&#8217;s Bay, and
known as the &#8220;Silent Places&#8221; over to the west,
where the Yukon begins and joins itself to
Alaska. To these were added many tales of the
Soudan and Indian by O&#8217;Hara, who had served
in the British army.</p>
<p>When they retired that night the troopers refused
to accept the share of the tent offered them,
but taking the hammocks which they carried,
from their saddlegear, fastened it to trees, and
with their ponchos and mosquito nettings over
them, calmly retired for the night.</p>
<p>It was noon the next day when Swiftwater
and the Scouts with him slipped slowly down the
river in their barge, and tied up to the bank. He
greeted the Northwest Mounted Police with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
pleasure, but showed considerable perturbation
when the story of the attack on the camp was related.
He at once investigated the extent of the
raid on the stores, and was evidently much
pleased to find that although the robbers had
taken considerable loot with them they had not
had time to load up the parts of the machinery
which they sorted out.</p>
<p>On Sunday afternoon the troopers took their
departure, saying that they would cover the creek
on their way down, and try to find out where
the gang and their Indians had gone to. Swiftwater
promised to follow down the creek in a few
days and up the Lewes and file a formal complaint
at White Horse. The &#8220;green stuff&#8221; and trout
which the expedition had brought back made a
most acceptable Sunday dinner, and after it was
over Swiftwater gave the boys a small talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I propose,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to get to work to-morrow
morning and erect the last and most important
building of our little city in the wilderness
here, and that is the cache. I&#8217;m going to hang
onto this Injun we have here, although he won&#8217;t
be of any use to us, and take him before the Commissioner
in White Horse and find out the reason
for his leaving all of a sudden. If there&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
anything important in that ivory horn he&#8217;s got
I&#8217;m going to find it out for you boys and see if
he can be of any use to you. We can leave this
camp shipshape in two days. We&#8217;ll simply drift
down the Gold, and wait at the entrance to the
Lewes for the steamer up from Dawson to White
Horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the following Monday morning the Scouts
went heartily to work, and by night had erected
a rough house of planks without windows, and
raised from the ground about a dozen feet on
spars built in bridgework shape. Into this was
conveyed all the remaining stores and the machinery,
the whole being covered with heavy tarpaulins
and tightly tied.</p>
<p>The cache was raised from the ground to prevent
bears and other marauders from reaching
the provisions it contained, and the shelter was
sufficient for all the stuff left behind.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning the tent was pulled
down, the provisions necessary for their few days&#8217;
journey placed aboard, the wounded chief helped
into the craft, and as the boat drifted out into
the stream the Creston Patrol of Scouts stood at
attention, and with their bugle sounded a salute
to their first camp in the wilderness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>ALASKA&#8217;S FIRST AIRSHIP.</h3>
</div>

<p>The Scouts and their commander reached the
mouth of the Gold early in the evening, and
made camp on their old ground, the sandy spit
between the two rivers. The steamer from Dawson
was due some time during the night, and before
they turned in they set up a red lantern on
the long steering sweep as a signal. The dawn
had broken when the hoarse siren of the steamer
was heard down the Lewes, and by the time all
hands were awake she was backing water at the
mouth of the Gold. The flat boat was quickly
poled out to her, and what Swiftwater called
their &#8220;dunnage&#8221; was placed aboard. Then, with
the steamer&#8217;s boat in tow the batteau was taken
back into the mouth of the creek and securely
anchored to the bank to be called for by Colonel
Snow&#8217;s men the following fall.</p>
<p>The trip to White Horse was uneventful, and
from there the boys, after a call on Major McClintock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
at the Mounted Police post, where they
left thanks for their rescuers, who had not yet
returned from their patrol duty, took a train to
Skagway. They found Colonel Snow awaiting
them, and after Swiftwater had given an account
of the work at the camp on the Gold, preparations
were made for the journey down the Yukon
to St. Michaels and the Seward Peninsula, where
Colonel Snow had some further business to transact
for the government. Traveling in Yukon
and Alaska is expensive, but Colonel Snow had
agreed to defray the expenses of the trip from
Skagway to Nome in payment for the boys&#8217; services
in the camp, and they had already confided
to him the scheme they had in mind to make
some money for themselves.</p>
<p>The Scouts had given every attention to detail
in setting up the machine, and the apparatus had
been given a tryout by frequent runs across the
grass and short lifts into the air. A small grandstand
had been built for the town officials and
invited guests, and the Scouts attired in their
khaki uniforms and broad hats acted as a reception
committee and as ushers.</p>
<p>Swiftwater, who was to go down the Yukon
to Dawson with them on his way to the Fairbanks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
mining district, where he proposed to carve
out what he termed a new &#8220;stake,&#8221; acted as box
office man and ticket taker. There were nearly
two thousand persons on the grounds when the
boys brought out from its canvas hanger the neat
double plane with its bright motor and varnished
propeller. The skids had been replaced with rubber
tired bicycle wheels and the controls were of
the latest pattern. The machine was dressed with
tiny flags, and out of compliment to the neighboring
Yukon territory the British colors shared the
display equally with the American flag.</p>
<p>The hour of the ascent was announced by a
bugle call, and the boys surrounded the aeroplane
to keep the crowd back, when Gerald climbed into
the seat. A cleared space of nearly a quarter of a
mile had been reserved for him, and starting the
motor he glided gently away over the grass, then
lifted his forward plane and rose into the air. He
lifted the plane to about two hundred feet, circled
the lower end of the field and came back over the
heads of the crowd. As he swept over the grand
stand the astonished crowd recovered somewhat
from its amazement and sent forth a mighty cheer
that was added to by almost as great a throng
outside the grounds. Having given the crowd
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
an opportunity to inspect the machine at close
quarters, Gerald began to mount in spirals until
he reached an altitude of nearly two thousand
feet, after which he headed directly for the summit
of one of the lofty mountains that form the
natural features of the Skagway region. It was
nearly a dozen miles away, but he passed over the
intervening country at a speed of nearly sixty
miles an hour, and after the lapse of about twenty
minutes returned, and dropping slowly in spirals,
glided gently to earth within a score of feet of
the spot from which he had risen.</p>
<p>Soon after their return to Skagway the mysterious
&#8220;piano case&#8221; was brought out of storage
and unpacked, a vacant but fenced lot was rented
and the first aeroplane that Alaska had ever seen
was soon put together, and was in process of being
tuned up.</p>
<p>As has been told in a previous volume, the
Creston Patrol of Boy Scouts had become fairly
proficient airmen, having constructed a glider
which in a contest had won for them a motor
with which they later equipped an airship. Gerald,
especially, had shown himself a most capable
and courageous aviator, and only a short time
before coming to Alaska had received from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
Aeronautical Society his license as a full fledged
air pilot. Needless to say their exhibition was the
notable event of the year, and it added as well a
goodly sum to the boys&#8217; exchequer.</p>
<p>Citizens and visitors were delighted with the exhibition,
and begged for another day of the same
thing, but Colonel Snow was anxious to be on
his way to the Klondike country, and could not
allow the boys more time. The sum realized was
not only satisfactory to the town officials, but the
share coming to the boys went a considerable way
toward providing funds for their trip down the
Yukon.</p>
<p>The aeroplane was loosely crated for the journey,
and early in the month of July the Scouts
took the train for their second trip from Skagway
to White Horse. Upon their arrival at the
end of their three hours&#8217; journey, Colonel Snow,
Rand and Swiftwater repaired to a nearby Siwash
village, to which the wounded chief had
been conveyed upon their return from Gold Creek
and found him nearly recovered from his injury.</p>
<p>He showed considerable satisfaction at meeting
them, and was evidently very grateful to
Swiftwater and the boys for their kindness to
him. He said the return of the ancient tribal relic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
had greatly rejoiced the members of the tribe,
and had aroused great interest among the older
men in the old legends attached to the heirloom.
These had to do with a great wealth of ivory
which had been stored in a cave at the top of a
cliff during a tribal war over a hundred years before,
and that this cave was in the mountains
which &#8220;ended near the Great Water.&#8221; As near
as Swiftwater could make out the mountains referred
to were either the great Alaskan range
which swings in a semicircle across the territory
from the international boundary on the Yukon,
where the range bears the name of Nuzotin, west
to Cook Inlet, an arm of the North Pacific Ocean
or the Chugach or Kenai ranges nearer the coast.
Four great peaks are features of the Alaskan
range, chief of them being Mount McKinley, the
highest mountain in all America&mdash;20,464 feet&mdash;until
recently unconquered by any of the ambitious
mountain climbers who have attacked it.</p>
<p>The chief said further that some of his young
men were ambitious to hunt for this peak, and
that he himself would go with them over into the
Cook Inlet region for the salmon fishing, and
later would take up a search through the mountains
aided by a remnant of the tribe which still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
haunts that section. He promised Rand that
should the treasure be found he would share with
the boys who had returned their ancient relic to
the village.</p>
<p>While Colonel Snow had little faith in the existence
of the cave or the possibility of its rediscovery,
he saw that the spirit of adventure was
aroused in the boys, and as he proposed that they
should see as much as possible of Alaska, and as
he himself must later visit the copper mining region
he made an arrangement to meet the chief
at Seward in the Kenai Peninsula, the end of the
military cable to Seattle, late in August.</p>
<p>The Indians greatly desired that the boys
should visit their village that night for a &#8220;potlatch,&#8221;
but as they could not do so the villagers
insisted on presenting each of the party with a
handsome hand woven blanket, the manufacture
of which is the chief native industry.</p>
<p>Meantime, the other boys had paid a visit to
the Custom House to give bond for their airship,
but as the collector could find nothing of
the kind on the tariff list, as none had ever been
entered at a Yukon customs house, he concluded
it was exempt and allowed it free entry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see that the members of your Congress insist
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
that a protective tariff is for the primary purpose
of preventing foreign competition with home
industries. As I do not believe that you will find
an aviation industry on the Yukon, I guess I am
safe in letting you take your machine through.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys also visited the police barracks and
found their three friends of the forest patrol
whom they again heartily thanked. At seven
o&#8217;clock, at what would have been night anywhere
else, they went aboard the &#8220;Yukoner&#8221; with the
aeroplane, and an hour later cast off lines for
Dawson. Here another exhibition was made, and
under Swiftwater&#8217;s guidance a visit paid to the
mining camps.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>DOWN THE RIVER TO NOME.</h3>
</div>

<p>Two days later, Colonel Snow and the boys,
accompanied by Swiftwater, having taken
leave of their new made friends at Dawson, embarked
on a small launch (a new importation
from the States) and started on a leisure trip
down the Yukon, intending to use this means of
river travel as far as the military post at Fort
Gibbon, at the mouth of the Tanana, up which
river Swiftwater was to proceed to the Fairbanks
mining district, the latest discovered and most
important in Alaska.</p>
<p>Colonel Snow&#8217;s plan was to drop down the
river in the swift motor boat, stopping at several
army posts where he had friends, some of
whom had come up from Seattle with the party
and had extended the hospitalities of the various
posts to them. They had left the crated aeroplane
at Dawson with other heavy baggage to
come down on the large river steamer Amelia,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
which was not due on its first trip up from St.
Michael&#8217;s for nearly a week, and which would
overtake them on its return trip down the river
at Fort Gibbon, another United States Army
post.</p>
<p>The first stop of the party was to be at Eagle,
a small, but prosperous town, on the boundary
line between Alaska and Yukon territory, containing
the most northerly custom house of the
United States. Here they were to &#8220;declare&#8221; the
aeroplane and the property they were to bring
back into the United States and satisfy the customs
authorities that it was all of American
manufacture, after which it would be examined
and passed when the &#8220;Amelia&#8221; came along. Adjoining
the town of Eagle is the army post of
Fort Egbert, garrisoned by two companies of
infantry, and here Colonel Snow proposed to
spend the night with his brother officers as their
first stopping place.</p>
<p>The distance from Dawson to Eagle is about
150 miles, but the high powered launch they had
secured with a crew of two, running down stream
made easily thirty miles an hour, and they expected
to reach their destination early in the
afternoon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel, if ye don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; said Swiftwater,
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to stop off an hour or so up at Forty-mile,
jest above here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied the Colonel, &#8220;we&#8217;re making
first-class progress and shall have plenty of
time to reach Eagle before night. There&#8217;s a wireless
station and a line of military telegraph to the
coast at Eagle, and I simply desire to get there
early enough to get off some dispatches to Washington
before the post telegraph office closes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W-w-hat&#8217;s &#8216;Forty-mile?&#8217; I&#8217;ve heard of
&#8216;Forty-rod,&#8217; but never of &#8216;Forty-mile,&#8217;&#8221; remarked
Pepper flippantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wa-al,&#8221; drawled the miner, &#8220;they was pretty
near synon&#8217;mous, as you say, when I first knew
the place. Forty-mile is the only civilized place
of habitation between Dawson and Eagle. It&#8217;s
on the Yukon side of the river, and is a trading
station for the Forty-mile mining district, the first
real gold mining region opened up in this region.
It was the scene of my early triumphs as a &#8216;sourdough&#8217;
after I left the whaling business, and I
&#8216;mushed&#8217; into it in the winter along with Dowling,
the great mail carrier of this region, who carried
the mail up the Yukon on the ice, with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
dog team, nine hundred miles between Dawson
and Fort Gibbon once a month.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got a good paying claim on Forty-mile Creek
and took out so much rich gravel that winter that
after I cleaned up in the spring I got an idea
that I didn&#8217;t need any more, and sold out and
hiked for the States. It didn&#8217;t last long, and I
had to come back, but not up here. I thought
I&#8217;d like to stop for an hour or so and see if any
of my old partners were here.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was little of interest at Forty-mile, except
the big warehouses of the trading companies,
but they had dinner ashore, and Swiftwater managed
to find among the scanty population one or
two of his old comrades, who had given up the
search for gold and were content to work for
the trading companies. A rapid but uneventful
run during the afternoon brought them to Eagle,
where they were greeted with delight by the three
hundred or more citizens, and the few army officers,
who, after welcoming the party, carried the
Colonel off to the barracks, the boys being quartered
in the only hotel of the place, run by the
postmistress of the town, who had formerly been
a school teacher in the States, and who made the
boys&#8217; stay delightfully homelike.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>Desiring to make Circle the next day, a distance
of nearly two hundred miles by the river,
they left Eagle at an early hour after taking on
board a supply of fuel of a rather questionable
character, for which they had to pay a heavy
price. The trading companies said that this was
the second launch that had visited Eagle and the
demand for high-grade fuel was not great.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, boys, what is &#8216;mush&#8217;?&#8221; asked Jack, suddenly,
as they sped down the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;C-c-cornmeal, salt and water, boiled,&#8221; promptly
spoke up Pepper, who was the expert on most
things edible.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what we make de pone an&#8217; de hoecake of,
honey,&#8221; corrected Rand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; broke in Don, &#8220;but I hear it&#8217;s some
foolish substitute for oatmeal porridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My uncle feeds the chickens lots of it out on
his farm,&#8221; insisted Dick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, here,&#8221; cried Jack, as soon as he could
get in a word. &#8220;My mind isn&#8217;t constantly on the
menu. It&#8217;s queer how a young man&#8217;s fancy constantly
turns to something to eat at any time of
day. I&#8217;m talking of some word that Swiftwater
used yesterday, referring to Forty-mile.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Better ask him,&#8221; suggested Rand, &#8220;he&#8217;s an
awful good explainer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The miner, who had been talking with Colonel
Snow about the value of Alaska mining investments
in various districts, heard his name
mentioned and turned with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Swiftwater&#8217;s latest crime?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to know what you meant by the
word &#8216;mush&#8217; you used yesterday,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that means simply gettin&#8217; somewhere; jest
walkin&#8217; which, I might say, has been up to this
time the chief means of communication in this
big Alaska. I don&#8217;t know where the word come
from, but it was here when I arrived. I always
supposed it was Eskimo. The whole Eskimo
language, before I learned it, used to sound to
me like a mouthful of it. However, a young
feller who was up here some years ago, a newspaper
man like you (he was with a party of
United States senators), gave me a new idea on
the matter. He showed me that the most of
Alaska that wasn&#8217;t forest and mountain and rock
was just a soft wet spongy mat of roots and grass
and moss that every step on it just pernounced
the word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you mean McClain,&#8221; exclaimed Colonel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
Snow. &#8220;I&#8217;ve read his work, and it is the most
lucid, modest, and understandable descriptive
work on the Alaskan country that has yet appeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>The low grade fuel and inferior oil which they
had taken aboard at Eagle had its effect on the
engine which showed signs of &#8220;laying down,&#8221; as
the engineer said, several times during the day.
Finally, after a peculiarly vicious splutter the
motor &#8220;backfired,&#8221; setting the oil soaked dungarees
of the engineer aflame, and promptly &#8220;died.&#8221;
The engineer did not hesitate with so much oil
and gasoline around him, but went over the side
into the Yukon with one hand on the gunwale
and, as soon as his burning clothing was soaked,
was helped aboard again by his companion.</p>
<p>It became absolutely necessary to clean the engine,
and while one of the boys kept the launch
in the middle of the river as it drifted, with an
oar, the others rolled up their sleeves, and with
the knowledge gained from their aeroplane motors,
aided the steersman to disconnect and clean
the machinery. Meantime the engineer arrayed
himself in dry clothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said he, as he came out of the
cabin, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know we had a group of experts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
aboard. I supposed the aviator that went up
yesterday knew all about it, but this help will save
us about an hour&#8217;s time, and we haven&#8217;t been
getting any too much speed out of her to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The engine behaved excellently for the rest of
the day, and about five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon
they landed at the town of Circle.</p>
<p>They found it a village of a couple of hundred,
the supply point for the Birch Creek mining region.</p>
<p>At an early hour the next morning they were
again on the bosom of the river, the engine having
again been cleaned and &#8220;nursed&#8221; as the engineer
described it for the day. The river had begun
to widen and the bank to fall to almost a dead
level just before reaching Circle the night before,
and they now entered upon a dreary expanse of
tundra or flat marsh land covered with a meager
growth of willow and stunted birch. The river
spread out to a width of nearly a dozen miles,
dividing into many channels surrounding small
bushy islands and rendering navigation very difficult.
The wheelman, who was an old river pilot,
was thoroughly acquainted with what he
called the &#8220;Yukon flats,&#8221; and managed to elude
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
the sandbars and sunken islands with considerable
dexterity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is,&#8221; he confided to Swiftwater,
&#8220;that this old river is closed six months in the
year, and we never can tell whether we&#8217;re goin&#8217;
to find any of it here when the ice goes out in
the spring. It wanders &#8217;round as if it had no
home or mother, and where we find a twenty-foot
channel this fall there may be a dusty wagon
road next spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>At nine o&#8217;clock in the forenoon, Swiftwater
rose and stepped onto the roof of the cabin and
scanned the far-off shore intently. Suddenly, he
turned to the interested Scouts, and removing his
broad brim made a mock bow and said impressively:</p>
<p>&#8220;Young fellows, let me welcome you to the
Frigid Zone; we have just crossed Arctic Circle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&mdash;wha&mdash;where is it?&#8221; cried Pepper
excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s what?&#8221; asked Swiftwater.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th-the Circle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All in your imagination, if you&#8217;ll remember
back to your geography,&#8221; replied the miner,
with a smile, while the other boys who were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
slightly awed by the new situation, for a moment,
gave a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t appear to be very frigid, does it?&#8221; remarked
the Colonel, and the boys, who, for the
first time, felt that they had really invaded the
&#8220;Terrible North&#8221; of the explorers, gazed with
new interest on the lush green meadows of the
shores and the foliage of the tree-covered island.</p>
<p>They ran on down the river, and an hour later
landed at Fort Yukon, an abandoned military
post, the most northerly point on the river, lying
at the mouth of the Porcupine, the Yukon&#8217;s most
important tributary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>ON THE SEWARD PENINSULA.</h3>
</div>

<p>The voyagers left Fort Yukon the same afternoon
and soon recrossing the Arctic Circle,
continued on the dreary Yukon Flats, where
the river broadened to more than thirty miles.
As there was almost perfect daylight at midnight
they proposed to sleep on board and continue the
journey.</p>
<p>In spite of the clouds of mosquitos, which managed
to invade even the well-closed in cabin, they
passed a restful night, the engine working perfectly,
and soon passed into the narrower reaches
of the Yukon, and in the early morning came to
the town of Rampart.</p>
<p>Here is a federal court which people come
nearly a thousand miles to attend. There was
also a telegraph station the end of the line to St.
Michael&#8217;s and Colonel Snow stopped only long
enough to send certain despatches to that point.
Then, again aboard the launch, they put on all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
speed, the purpose being to reach the mouth of
the Tanana and Fort Gibbon that night. The
day&#8217;s journey was almost as uninteresting as that
through the Yukon Flats, for while the river was
narrower, the banks were low, thinly wooded and
monotonous. Along in the afternoon they
reached the mouth of the Tanana and landed at
the town of that name, next to which stands the
military post of Fort Gibbon, where Colonel
Snow was to be a guest until the arrival of the
down river steamer from Dawson.</p>
<p>Two days later the steamer Amelia put in an
appearance, and they boarded her, to find their
aeroplane and baggage aboard. Swiftwater Jim,
who was to journey up the Tanana, had stayed to
bid them gooybye, and the boys parted with him
with real regret. He promised faithfully that
after he had made his &#8220;stake&#8221; he would come out
to the &#8220;States&#8221; again, and would visit them at
their homes. As the steamer backed out the boys
gathered at the bow and gave him the Scouts&#8217;
salute and a hearty cheer.</p>
<p>The journey down the lower Yukon, while unimpressive
as to scenery, was pleasant in many
respects, as the boys made many acquaintances
who were thoroughly acquainted with the river,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
along which were many old missions and Indian
villages. At several of these stops were made,
and the boys found many curiosities along the
shores. At one place they visited a museum that
contained three of the gigantic ivory tusks of the
mammoth of which they had read a good deal
since finding the narwhal&#8217;s horn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; said Gerald, &#8220;they must weigh nearly
a hundred pounds apiece. If we ever find that
cave with anything in it, it ought to be worth a
good deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose that the chief will show up at
Seward?&#8221; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I think so,&#8221; said Rand. &#8220;I think he
was very grateful for the way we treated him, and
I understand these Indians are much like ours at
home, and usually remember a favor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care so much for the ivory as for the
good story we will get out of it, if the whole
thing turns out as we hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s you newspaper men again,&#8221; said Don,
&#8220;always after a good story, but why not take the
ivory too if we find it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; put in Pepper, &#8220;we&#8217;ll soon know, for
Colonel Snow said last night that we should remain
in St. Michael&#8217;s only until the Seattle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
steamer comes up to take us over to Nome, and
he proposes to sail South with her, when she returns.
Then we shall land at Seward, and meet
the chief if he is there, and find out whether he
has discovered the location of the cave.&#8221;</p>
<p>The travelers were surprised to find the mouth
of the Yukon spread out over an enormous expanse
of country before it finally empties into
Behring Sea. The river, about ninety miles from
the sea, begins to split up into separate streams,
and is said to have nine or ten mouths.</p>
<p>Behring&#8217;s Sea is very shallow, and the waters
are most of the time very rough, especially for the
flat-bottomed boats that ply upon the Yukon. St.
Michael&#8217;s lies about seventy miles up the coast
from the mouth of the river which is used by the
steamers, and the passage is uncomfortable, not
to say, at times, dangerous.</p>
<p>The ground swell of the shallow sea tested the
seamanship of the young Scouts to the utmost
and one or two of them retired to their stateroom,
but as a large proportion of the passengers were
affected in the same way there was very little disposition
to deride the unfortunates, as had been
done on the trip up the &#8220;Inside Passage.&#8221; They
arrived safely, however, and were again accorded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
a warm welcome by Colonel Snow&#8217;s comrades of
the army, who at once took them to the post,
which is the chief institution of importance in the
small town.</p>
<p>St. Michael&#8217;s is situated on an island which
constitutes a military reservation of the United
States. Russia, in 1833, established a trading
post there, and one of the curiosities of the place
is the old Russian block house, a relic of primitive
ideas in warfare. The town is the point of departure
for the Yukon River steamers, and the
aeroplane and the other luggage was taken off
here to be placed on the Seattle steamer, which
was to take them over to the Seward Peninsula,
the other side of Norton Sound.</p>
<p>There are two small Indian villages on the island,
and the boys spent part of a day in the inspection
of these, buying large quantities of curiosities
and looking on with interest at a &#8220;potlatch,&#8221;
an institution which means the entertainment
of a man&#8217;s neighbors so long as his goods
hold out, and the host generally finds himself
ready for a receiver by the time the entertainment
ends.</p>
<p>The officers of the post were greatly interested
in the aeroplane, and it was uncrated for their inspection,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
but stormy conditions on Behring&#8217;s Sea
during their stay prevented a flight.</p>
<p>Two days after their arrival, the steamer from
Seattle to Nome came along and they embarked
and steamed the 112 miles across Norton&#8217;s Sound
to Nome, the metropolis of that great northwestern
section of Alaska that borders on the Arctic
Ocean and extends within forty miles of Asia.
There is no harbor at Nome, and the ships must
lie about a mile off shore, while passengers and
freight are taken in on flatboats, from which
everything is raised on an elevator by a gigantic
crane, and swung in shore.</p>
<p>Nome is one of the largest cities of Alaska, having
a summer population of nearly 8,000. It is
a lively, public-spirited place, and the army officers
and business men greeted with enthusiasm the
proposal of an airship exhibition.</p>
<p>Colonel Snow was especially in favor of it, as
the army had already begun to take a great interest
in aviation, and the officers desired an opportunity
to inspect the workings of the machine.
A popular subscription was decided on for the
boys, and a sum amounting to about fifteen hundred
dollars was quickly provided.</p>
<p>The beach at Nome, from which most of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
gold of that region has been extracted, was found
to make a fine starting field, and, as the country
back of the town is mostly flat &#8220;tundra&#8221; or moss
covered ground, with no trees to interfere, the
flights made by Gerald were the most successful of
his career. He delighted the army officers by
taking them up, one at a time for short flights,
and the citizens were so enthusiastic that they offered
the boys almost any price they might name
for the airship. Their affection for it was too
great, however, and they refused to sell.</p>
<p>The Scouts were shown every attention, and
were taken for a ride on the &#8220;Farthest North&#8221;
railroad, known as the &#8220;Wild Goose&#8221; road, leading
up to some of the most important placer mines
on the peninsula. The Scout uniform caught the
fancy of some of the young men of the town,
and when the organization had been explained
to them they organized two patrols, and Colonel
Snow administered the first degree of the ritual.</p>
<p>In three days the steamer for Seattle was ready
to sail, and the boys bid farewell to their new
friends and started on the homeward leg of their
journey. Steaming far to the westward to get
around the long reach of the Alaska Peninsula
they sailed a thousand miles south, and at Dutch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
Harbor on Unalaska Island they transferred to
the line of steamers which was to take them along
the peninsula to Seward. Stopping part of a day
on Kodiak Island, they visited the great salmon
canneries at Karluk, where the boys were told
they could catch all the salmon they wanted.
They saw the great fish handled literally by the
ton and canned by machinery. The boys disembarked
with the aeroplane at Seward and found
the chief and three of his men awaiting them, with
the news that they believed that they had discovered
the cave.</p>
<p>&#8220;No can get him. Very high. Most to sky,&#8221;
the chief told Rand, and indicated in &#8220;pigeon&#8221;
that the cliff was a pinnacle of three spires of rock
standing alone and utterly inaccessible from any
side. He said it was two days&#8217; journey by easy
trail, and that they would take horses.</p>
<p>Colonel Snow, deciding that the trip would be
an interesting experience for the boys, provided
them with pack horses and a trusty guide, in addition
to the Indians. He was opposed at first to
their trying to take the aeroplane into the mountainous
regions, but finding that it could be conveyed
by pack horses without trouble, and that
the boys had some project on hand which made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
it very desirable to them withdrew his objections.
He exacted a promise, however, that if they got
into difficulties with it they would abandon it at
once. He himself had business at Cordova and
up the Copper River Railroad, and he agreed to
meet them at the steamer from Seward to Cordova
at the latter port within a week or ten days
at the utmost.</p>
<p>The United States Government has in recent
years constructed a large number of miles of good
wagon roads and trails in different parts of
Alaska, and nearly three-quarters of the distance
to the point to which they were bound was thus
equipped. The guide engaged for them was an
old miner of the character of Swiftwater, and he
was employed as a mail carrier and driver over
the winter roads from Valdez to Fairbanks.</p>
<p>Horses were provided for the boys for such a
distance as trails could be found, and from that
point they would take only the pack animals and
get through as they could. By taking out the
motor, it was found that the plane could be easily
carried by two animals, and the machinery was
distributed between two others. Beyond some
small food supplies and a quantity of strong rope
no other luggage was taken.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>The roads were found to be so good that although
the trail ran right up into the foothills
of the Kenai range they made excellent progress
the first day and camped in a little mountain
meadow full of late flowers, and with good running
water.</p>
<p>They used gasoline for cooking, as they had
brought along sufficient for use in the aeroplane
and the Indians fed by themselves on salmon and
other fish. Away in the distance, more than a
hundred miles, could be seen the giant peaks of
the Alaskan range&mdash;the backbone of Alaska&mdash;Foraker,
Russell, Spurr and McKinley, snow clad
and dazzling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like a chance to climb one of those big
mountains,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;You know we didn&#8217;t
get an opportunity in the Canadian Rockies, although
they seemed to be very near.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; said Rand, &#8220;that we&#8217;ve got all we
can do to climb the mountain we&#8217;re looking for.
We&#8217;ll be lucky if we do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did the Indians or whoever hid this
ivory, if there&#8217;s any there, get it up to the cave,
if it is a cave?&#8221; asked Don the Doubter.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got to find out; also how
we&#8217;re going to get up there ourselves,&#8221; said Dick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have a way to do that,&#8221; said Gerald,
&#8220;but we&#8217;ve got to know the size and shape
of this hill or peak or whatever it is, before we
decide how to climb it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Pepper, with a yawn, &#8220;I move we
go to bed now and get up early and get on the
road and try and reach the place before night,&#8221;
and he rose rather stiffly, for he was not known
at home as a great admirer of horsemanship, and
the day&#8217;s journey had told on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep watch for awhile yet,&#8221; said the guide,
&#8220;and then I&#8217;ll put one of the Injuns on. Don&#8217;t
get scared if ye hear a shot early in the mornin&#8217;,
for I&#8217;m goin&#8217; out to see if I can get a caribou. I
hear they&#8217;re pretty thick up here in the foothills,
and it&#8217;ll tickle these Injuns to death. The poor
fellers have been workin&#8217; the canneries all summer
and ain&#8217;t had a mouthful of fresh meat all
that time. A little feast&#8217;ll put more heart into
&#8217;em for the work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys camped under a cluster of small trees
with ponchos and blankets over them, and as the
black flies had disappeared and mosquitos were
few, enjoyed a good night&#8217;s rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>THE MAMMOTH&#8217;S TUSKS.</h3>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, the camp was awakened at an
early hour the next day by a couple of rifle
shots, and an excited commotion among the Indians.
The boys in whom, as in all healthy American
youths, the hunting instinct was strong, at
once scrambled from under their blankets, seized
their rifles and dashed through the bushes toward
the small stream which flowed from the mountains
toward an arm of Prince William Sound.</p>
<p>A dozen rods from the camp, they came upon
the guide and the Indians standing around a large
bull caribou whose head boasted a magnificent
pair of antlers. The animal&#8217;s throat had been cut
and the Indians had already set to work to take
off the hide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got him the first shot,&#8221; said the guide, &#8220;and
tried to get another, but they was too swift fer
me. They was six in the herd. However, this is
enough, and the poor things is bein&#8217; killed off fast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
enough fer their hides and horns without our
takin&#8217; more&#8217;n we need.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you call us?&#8221; asked Jack, &#8220;I
should like to have got a shot at some big game
before we leave Alaska.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fer that very reason,&#8221; replied the guide, &#8220;it&#8217;s
the close season now, and we can only kill what
we need for meat. Besides that, it&#8217;s ticklish business
gettin&#8217; a shot at caribou, and two persons
would have made more noise than one, and I
wanted very much to get one or two fer these
Indians, who need it, as I told you. Hurry up
there, you Siwash, and get yer meat and have yer
feast fer we&#8217;ve got to be movin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a handsome pair of antlers,&#8221; said Rand,
who was something of a naturalist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Best head I ever see,&#8221; said the guide. &#8220;I&#8217;d
be glad to make ye a present of it if there was any
chance of yer gettin&#8217; it out of Alaska at this season.
However, we&#8217;ll take it back to Seward and
maybe Colonel Snow can find some way to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time two of the Indians had cut the
carcass up, while the others had built a hot fire.
Several steaks were cut off and roasted before the
flames under the guide&#8217;s direction for the boys&#8217;
breakfast, and they found the meat juicy and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
palatable. Then the Indians turned to and had
their &#8220;feast.&#8221; They partially roasted the flesh
in great chunks, and for an hour gorged themselves
like starving men just escaped from the
desert.</p>
<p>&#8220;T-t-hey won&#8217;t be able to walk,&#8221; commented
Pepper, after gazing at the gastronomic feat that
put any of his previous efforts in the shade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em alone fer that,&#8221; said the guide, &#8220;I
never in my life see anything that could carry a
bigger cargo of grub, and do a day&#8217;s work than
a Siwash. I s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s because starvation&#8217;s got
ter be a regeler perfession with &#8217;em. They can
lay in food like a camel does water, and then go
fer days without it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indians, having packed some of the meat
for the next day, cut the rest into thin strips, and
with the caribou&#8217;s head, hung them to the
branches of trees out of reach of bears, to be
called for on their return. The riding horses
were also turned loose, in a broad meadow to stay
until the return, and nothing but the pack animals
taken.</p>
<p>Their morning journey carried them higher
and higher into the foothills of the Kenai
range, and the trail became more rugged.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
About nine o&#8217;clock the Indians began to
show some eagerness and excitement, and
the chief told the guide that they would
soon sight the peaks. Finally, the Siwashes ran
ahead to the top of a sharp rise and excitedly
beckoned. The boys joined them, and as they
reached the summit of the ridge a peculiar scene
met their gaze.</p>
<p>The other side of the ridge sloped sharply for
nearly two hundred feet to a valley nearly half a
mile wide, paved with gravel and boulders, and
as bald of vegetation as a desert. The rocks on
the slope of the ridge and along the sides of this
wide shallow ravine were cut as sharply and worn
as smooth as if the stone cutter&#8217;s chisel had
shaped their surfaces.</p>
<p>A quarter of a mile distant, and almost in the
middle of the valley stood an immense obelisk of
rock some three hundred feet high, dividing, some
distance from the top into three sharp pinnacles.
On the surface of the middle spire could be seen
a small black dot. The Indians were dancing
with excitement, and the boys themselves felt a
thrill as they realized that they were nearing the
climax of a great mystery.</p>
<p>&#8220;That looks like a great river bed, in which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
the water had dried up,&#8221; remarked Rand, &#8220;I
never saw anything like it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bed of an old glacier,&#8221; said the guide, who
had come up. &#8220;Lots of &#8217;em in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That explains it, then,&#8221; said Jack, excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Explains what?&#8221; inquired Dick.</p>
<p>&#8220;How they got up there,&#8221; replied Jack. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you see? This valley was full of ice once nearly
to the tops of those rocks, and when it came down
and melted off, the bodies of the mammoths
dropped out, and the natives gathered the tusks
and stored them in the cave which they could
easily reach with the glacier so near the top.
Then the snow gave out somewhere in the mountains
and the glacier gradually pushed its way
out and melted, leaving the cave high and dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right for you, Jack,&#8221; said Gerald. &#8220;Begorra,
you&#8217;ve had that story already written, I
see. But it looks like the real goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve read of these things before,&#8221; replied Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about what happened,&#8221; commented the
guide. &#8220;Some geological sharps who were up
here last year explained one of these rocky holes
the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pack horses were now brought up to the
top of the ridge and unloaded, as they could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
very easily be taken down the valley slope. With
the greatest care the plane was removed from the
two pack animals, and with ropes lowered on its
own wheels down the gravelly slope. The motor
and other machinery was slid down upon skids
cut from the forest and placed along the bank.
At the bottom, the Scouts set to work putting the
machine together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the guide, with the air of a great
discoverer, &#8220;I see what yer scheme is now. Ye&#8217;re
goin&#8217; up in that arrerplane, and see if ye can git
a peek in that hole up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than that,&#8221; replied Gerald. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going to get up and get into that hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Delighted at finding they were nearing the goal
of their hopes with so few obstacles, the Scouts
worked cheerfully and earnestly upon the reassembling
of the plane, and by noon had replaced
the motor and tested every stay, brace and control.
Then, after a dinner of caribou meat and
coffee, they wheeled the plane over the gravel to
the foot of the great gray granite obelisk. As
they neared it they could see that the dot at the
summit took more and more the shape of the
ace of clubs, the mouth of the cave appearing as
if cut by the hand of an artist, into gothic form.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
The Indians were awe-stricken spectators,
scarcely able to raise a hand to work, so impressed
were they with the preparations.</p>
<p>Some seven hundred feet of strong, but light
manila rope had been attached to the lower frame
of the machine, and to guard against accidents as
much more had been coiled under the seat. It
was Gerald&#8217;s intention to rise over the obelisk,
and trail the rope over the rock between two of
the pinnacles, thus affording means for the raising
eventually of a block and tackle and a rope
ladder by which they would be able to reach the
summit. But the &#8220;best laid plans o&#8217; mice and
men&#8221; and even Boy Scouts, &#8220;gang agley,&#8221; as
Burns says.</p>
<p>They found a patch of smooth gravel, clear
enough of boulders to allow the aviator to make
an excellent start, and after trying out the engine
to find that it was working without a flaw, Gerald
got a fine running start and mounted into
the air. Working west half a mile, mounting all
the time to raise his trailing rope from the
ground, he turned and circled around the mighty
mass of rock looking for the most likely point
on the top over which to trail his line. As he
passed he caught a glimpse of the interior of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
cave, and saw that it was much larger than it
looked from the ground to be.</p>
<p>Turning again, he concluded to pass between
two of the pinnacles, and immediately volplane
down on the other side. As he approached the
rock he shut off the engine, and the aeroplane
began to slow down. The propellor stopped, and
the plane sank perceptibly. One plane struck the
side of a pinnacle and crumpled up, the weight of
the engine carried the middle section, and the
machine sank down a wrecked mass of canvas and
wires upon a narrow plateau between two of the
points. Gerald was scarcely jarred from his seat
by the impact and soon freed himself from the
wreckage to find himself marooned upon the top
of a perpendicular rock three hundred feet from
the ground. The Scouts and the Indians set up
a cry of dismay when the possibility of the disaster
became apparent, but as soon as he had freed
himself, Gerald assured them of his safety, and
of the fact that he had plenty of room to stand
and move around upon. Another thing that relieved
their fears was that he had about sixteen
hundred feet of rope available. He first gave his
attention to the cave, and found that by an easy
climb of seven feet he could reach the mouth. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
found the hole to be about ten feet deep, by as
many broad. It was perfectly lighted and piled
in the rear was what appeared to be an indiscriminate
mass of bones buried under a pile of dust.
Dragging some of them out, he saw that the pile
consisted of some ten fine mammoth tusks, well
preserved, two of which were still attached to part
of the skull of the animal, a fine museum relic.
The rest was made up of a miscellaneous collection
of ivory&mdash;narwhal&#8217;s horns and tusks of the
walrus&mdash;all weighing about five hundred pounds.</p>
<p>There were also many Indian relics, nearly all
in a decayed condition. He soon notified his
companions of what the cave contained, and asked
them to send up the block and tackle on the rope
he had dragged over the pinnacle. Fastening the
block by a turn of the rope around a small point
of rock above his head, he bundled up the bones
in canvas cut from one of the planes and lowered
it to his comrades. When the last of the ivory
had been lowered, together with the Indian
relics which he thought the Siwashes might
prize, he took the other rope from the
aeroplane and knotted it at ten foot intervals.
This he fastened to another point of
rock and threw down. Then he placed a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
noose of the tackle rope around his body under
his arms. Yelling to his companions to lower
away he bent a last sorrowful look upon his beloved
aeroplane, and with tears in his eyes, swung
off with his knotted rope in his hands. Placing
his feet against the perpendicular rock, he swung
out by his knotted guide line, and fairly walked
down the face of the obelisk backward.</p>
<p>The loss of the machine and Gerald&#8217;s stupendous
adventure and escape was almost too much
for the emotions of the Boy Scouts, and with
watering eyes they surrounded their comrade
with many a hug and pat upon the back.</p>
<p>As for the Indians, they were on their knees
almost worshipping the mammoth&#8217;s tusks and the
Indian relics. To hide their emotions the boys
began at once preparations for departure. The
ivory was divided up, and under the guide&#8217;s direction
taken across the gravel and up the ridge,
where it was packed upon the horses. The remainder
of the stuff was abandoned, including
the ropes, gasoline and tools to keep the derelict
and exalted plane company. When they reached
the top of the ridge, and were about to descend
into the foothills, the Scouts turned, and with
bared heads paid a last tribute to the &#8220;First Airship
in Alaska.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>HOMEWARD BOUND.</h3>
</div>

<p>They camped that night on the site of their
previous resting place, and at early morning
gathered in their horses, some of which had
strayed for miles, and were soon on their road
back to Seward. By journeying rapidly, most of
the trail being down hill, they arrived at the town
early in the afternoon, where they found a despatch
from Colonel Snow, asking them to await
him there, as he would return to that port.</p>
<p>With the guide, they put in their time visiting
the surrounding country, and in a trip to the celebrated
Columbia glacier, considered the most
beautiful and impressive on Prince William&#8217;s
Sound. It is about four miles wide, and about
three hundred feet high. There are ten other
glaciers in Prince William&#8217;s Sound which keep
its magnificent fiords filled with icebergs which
fall from the glaciers, with the sound of thunder.
The Scouts made a trip over the ice fields of Columbia,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
which were full enough of ice bridges and
crevasses to furnish many a thrill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if there are any more mammoths on
ice under us here,&#8221; said Don as they tramped
over the snowy surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there are, we shan&#8217;t need an airship to get
them,&#8221; responded Rand.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;we shall want another kind
of ship if we catch any more of that sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two days later the steamer from Seattle, by
way of Cordova and Valdez, reached Seward
and the Colonel was a passenger. He brought
with him a large package of letters from Creston
which had been wandering over the Yukon, and
had finally come across from Eagle to Valdez
by way of Fairbanks.</p>
<p>The boys repeated the newsy gossip of their
home town, and exchanged their letters freely.
Pepper had three, however, which he read quietly
by himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Pepper,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;produce.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These are entirely for private consumption,&#8221;
replied Pepper, turning red, but with an effort at
dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty much everything you get your hands
on seems to be,&#8221; commented Dick, and the boys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
surrounded Pepper with joined hands, singing:
&#8220;I&#8217;ll Bet He&#8217;s Had a Letter from Home,&#8221; until
the badgered youth tackled his brother and broke
through the line of his tormentors. The Colonel
had also found at Valdez a brief letter from
Swiftwater, who announced that he had gotten
hold of what he considered a good claim, and if
any of his late &#8220;command&#8221; cared to come up and
help him work it, they might all be millionaires
before the following spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any of you care to take the job?&#8221; asked the
Colonel with a smile. &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken an interest
with Swiftwater in any claims he may file on,
and you might find it worth while. However,
I&#8217;m frank to say that, having gotten you this far
without disaster I should prefer to return you to
your homes safe and in good order.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reader may wish to follow the later adventures
of the Boy Scouts, and in the next volume,
&#8220;In the North Woods,&#8221; their further history will
be told.</p>
<p>The letters from home awakened many pleasant
memories, and perhaps a little feeling of home
sickness, and there was no eager acceptance of
the miner&#8217;s proposition, which, anyway, was
probably made in a joking spirit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; said Rand, &#8220;I should like to come
back here some time. I sometimes think that in
spite of the fact that this great territory is so
near the North Pole, it&#8217;s going to be a great commonwealth.
I want to see it in the winter time,
when they say it is so terrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, I think we&#8217;ve had enough of it for this
time,&#8221; put in Gerald, with a serious look. &#8220;I
want to get home and build another aeroplane.
They&#8217;ll be getting ahead of us on airships if we
stay away much longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I hae me doots,&#8221; put in the economical
Don, &#8220;if this country isn&#8217;t too expensive for just
regular living.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to write a book about this country,
and I want to get home to do it,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;I&#8217;m rather in favor of a
short visit to the old home at this time, just to
astonish the natives with a few of our adventures.
Since this patrol was formed, its experiences have
got to be a regular habit with the Creston folks,
and I have an idea they must miss something by
this time. I think it&#8217;s our duty to let them have
at least an &#8216;Old Home Week&#8217; to relieve their&mdash;hey,
what do you call it, Jack, in that high school
French of yours?&mdash;oh, yes, their <i>ongwee</i>.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the ingenious Pepper, unguardedly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got no reason&mdash;I just want to go
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to do with a sudden case of &#8216;private
consumption?&#8217;&#8221; cruelly remarked Jack, and
amid the shout of laughter that followed Pepper,
covered with a sunset glow, made a sudden exit
in search of the guide.</p>
<p>Colonel Snow had a conference with the Indians
after he had inspected the &#8220;treasure,&#8221; and
heard the story of its perilous recovery. He recognized
that the value of the mammoth tusks as
museum specimens was far greater than its worth
as ivory, and he offered to pay the Indians far
above its commercial value for their interest in
it, allowing them full possession of the remaining
ivory. They gladly accepted his suggestion, and
all of them returned to their village near Skagway,
with sufficient wealth to make them independent
until the next &#8220;potlatch,&#8221; when they
would probably give it all away.</p>
<p>After a conference with the old guide, Colonel
Snow made him an offer to join Swiftwater in
the Fairbanks region, and operate with him on
such claims as he should secure, and the old man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
prepared to return to his occupation as a miner,
by the first fall stage from Valdez.</p>
<p>Having secured an official permit to take the
caribou&#8217;s head out of the territory through the
influence of Colonel Snow, the whole party embarked
next day on the homeward bound steamer,
which leaving Seward, and stopping at Valdez
and Cordova, took the &#8220;outside passage,&#8221; for
their trip, giving the Scouts for the first time a
full taste of the Pacific Ocean. They proved
good sailors in this instance, however, and in a
few days stepped ashore in Seattle in their &#8220;Ain
Countree.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they crept into their berths in the Great
Northern&#8217;s Transcontinental Limited that night,
eastward bound, Jack said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Rand, what do you suppose became of Dublin,
Rae and Monkey? They seem to have missed
us lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard, Jack, of a bad penny, haven&#8217;t
you? Well, they&#8217;re three bad pence. Look out.&#8221;</p>
